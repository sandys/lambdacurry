*   **Programs –**
    *   [**Starting Strength**](http://amzn.to/18QGE7B) ([ebook edition](http://amzn.to/1cmvQx5)) or **Stronglifts** have a lot of following around the world. These programs are usually considered the gold standard.
    *   [All Pro](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=147447933&page=1) – is very popular on Bodybuilding.com forums.
    *   [Westside for skinny bastards](http://www.defrancostraining.com/articles/38-articles/60-westside-for-skinny-bastards-part1.html)
    *   [New Rules of Lifting](http://amzn.to/1cxACrE)
    *   [Huge in a Hurry](http://amzn.to/18Y9y5W)
    *   [P90X](http://amzn.to/1aVU7s6) or [P90X2](http://amzn.to/1cmwo67) has an accompanying DVD and is very popular in the USA.
    *   [Crossfit](http://amzn.to/1cmwMl9) – more than a fitness program, this is a huge community. Very, very popular – but some elements of its training are of doubtful benefit (e.g. kipping pullups)
*   **Shoes** – for weight lifting/powerlifting or general weight training. I strongly recommend Decathlon’s [Newfeel](http://www.flipkart.com/newfeel-lightweight-walking-shoes/p/itmdkg3h4ntgrtgb?pid=SHODKG3HR9Y4YXXA&affid=sandysgmai) shoes. However, these are flat, not with an elevated heel (so might impact some who have limited ankle flexibility)
*   **Power Rack** – lots of suppliers from Jalandhar. Around the Rs. 10,000/- range. Only buy if you are unable to find a suitable [gym](http://fitosaur.us/barbell-training-gyms-in-india/).
*   **Stretching & Foam/tennis ball myofascial release** - One of the best rolling I have ever done is for my lower back using a golf ball to recover from a bad deadlift session. I had gone for a week without the pain going down. Then, I took a golf ball and put under my back, rolled it into position to massage deep within the soft tissue of my lower back. It was painful and amazingly awesome. Oh and it worked!
