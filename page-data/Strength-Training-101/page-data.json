Very, very popular – but some elements of its training are of doubtful benefit (e.g. kipping pullups)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Shoes</strong> – for weight lifting/powerlifting or general weight training.

However, these are flat, not with an elevated heel (so might impact some who have limited ankle flexibility)</li>\n<li><strong>Power Rack</strong> – lots of suppliers from Jalandhar. Around the Rs. 10,000/- range. Only buy if you are unable to find a suitable <a href=\"http://fitosaur.us/barbell-training-gyms-in-india/\">gym</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Stretching &#x26; Foam/tennis ball myofascial release</strong> - One of the best rolling I have ever done is for my lower back using a golf ball to recover from a bad deadlift session. I had gone for a week without the pain going down. Then, I took a golf ball and put under my back, rolled it into position to massage deep within the soft tissue of my lower back. It was painful and amazingly awesome. Oh and it worked!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Strength Training 101","date":"July 31, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Strength-Training-101/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-07-29-learn-how-to-deadlift-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learn how to deadlift &#8211; step by step guide for beginners"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-08-05-platform-wars-net-and-the-jvm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Platform wars: .NET and the JVM"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
