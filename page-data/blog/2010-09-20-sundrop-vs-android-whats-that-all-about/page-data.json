Sundrop is a “bring your own VM” OS allowing the flexibility to choose non-infringing JVMs, or license Java from Oracle directly or not use Java at all.  Sundrop has no certification requirements as Google does which can also delay product development and freeze out vendors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Android OS’ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_(software)\">Dalvik VM</a> uses the Apache Harmony class library.  Replacing the JVM (as Sundrop claims) will only affect the class library.
