I have a decently respectably Core2Duo 1.8G, 2.5G RAM, nVidia Go7400 card.</p>\n<p>Doom ran spectacularly - at 1280 X 800 - my laptop’s native resolution. I had a lot of graphics eyecandy turned on. Mouse movement was fluid. The story, of course, sucks - but Doom/Quake has never been about the story anyway. It’s the experience.</p>\n<p>Bioshock was how 20,000 leagues under the sea would have looked, done in a 1940’s styling. The story and the plot was fabulous.</p>\n<p>The engine, however, crawled. I used all the latest patches from Direct2Drive - but it still crawled. The Unreal engine has been no stranger to controversy regarding it’s <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/gaming/busted/unreal-engine-3-half+baked-broken-and-late-280548.php\">quality</a> - however a lot of games still use it. As I was reading wikipedia about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4\">ID Tech 4</a> (as Doom3’s engine is known), I found out that most game creators did not use it because of it’s early lack of expansive views (a la <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry\">Farcry</a> ). However, ID soon released the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatexture\">MegaTexture</a> technology.</p>\n<p>The ID Tech 4 engine costs about <a href=\"http://www.idsoftware.com/business/idtech4/\">250,000$</a> - I am not sure if that is a factor. However, playing both the engines side by side, showed which one was more forgiving on older hardware.</p>\n<p>Which means <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)\">Rage</a> (with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatexture#Virtual_Texturing\">Virtual Texturing</a>) gets my vote - although I may end up buying it for my PS3.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Doom3 engine vs Bioshock (unreal)","date":"October 27, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-doom3-engine-vs-bioshock-unreal/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-how-a-countrys-it-infrastructure-is-held-hostage/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How a country's IT infrastructure is held hostage"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-dda-allotment-software-scam-and-audit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DDA allotment software - scam and audit"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
