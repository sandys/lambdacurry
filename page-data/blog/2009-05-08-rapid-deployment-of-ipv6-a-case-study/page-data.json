There is now a draft floating around in IETF, called 6rd, which plans to ease this, using a real life case study which went from proposal to deployment at 1.5 million users in a matter of <strong>5 weeks</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is called <a href=\"http://www.rfc-editor.org/internet-drafts/draft-despres-6rd-03.txt\">6RD</a> - 6 ‘Rapid Deployment’</p>\n<p>   Having ISPs to rapidly bring IPv6 to customers sites, in addition to\nIPv4 and without extra charge, is a way to break the existing vicious\ncircle that has delayed IPv6 deployment: ISPs wait for customer\ndemand before deploying IPv6; customers don’t demand IPv6 as long as\napplication vendors announce that their products work on existing\ninfrastructures (that are IPv4 with NATs); application vendors focus\ntheir investments on NAT traversal compatibility as long as ISPs\ndon’t deploy IPv6.</p>\n<p>   But most ISPs are not willing to add IPv6 to their current offer, at\nno charge, unless incurred investment and operational costs are\nextremely limited.  For this, ISPs that provide router CPEs to their\ncustomers have the most favorable conditions: they can upgrade their\nrouter CPEs to support IPv6 encapsulation and operate gateways\nbetween these infrastructures and the global IPv6 Internet to also do\nIPv6/v4 encapsulation, so that they can keep the routing plan of\ntheir IPv4 infrastructures.\nI hope the government picks this up and charts out a roadmap for IPV6 deployment - it is absolutely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion#Exhaustion_date\">urgent</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rapid deployment of IPV6 - a case study","date":"May 08, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-08-rapid-deployment-of-ipv6-a-case-study/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-08-s40-how-yahoo-can-take-over-the-mobile-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"S40: How Yahoo can take over the mobile world"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-09-security-protocol-for-an-india-wide-national-id/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Security protocol for an India-wide national ID"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
