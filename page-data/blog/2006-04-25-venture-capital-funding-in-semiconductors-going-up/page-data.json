However pre-money valuation has increased from 13.7 M to 20 M (I dunno if this is because the VC blokes have too much money to throw around, or has the general quality of the startups gone up??)</p>\n<p>Now for the bad news - # of deals in Design Automation software has gone down to 27 from last year’s 39 (Pg. 25). In fact the only segment in the semiconductor software industry which is going up is <strong>Communications/Connectivity</strong> (???)</p>\n<p>The EDA companies which successfully raised capital were also interesting - <strong>LVL7 Systems</strong> was the highest with $15M funding and <strong>Eridon</strong> the least with $1.7M funds (one more thing was that several of the EDA companies receiving funding were third/later rounds!!)</p>\n<p>Compare with ASIC or General purpose IC companies - highest funding was $48M for <strong>SolarFlare</strong> and least was $4.65M for <strong>MultiSpectral</strong> <strong>Imaging.</strong></p>\n<p>Number of semiconductor companies going for IPOs in the US market(Pg. 56) was 4 (+ 14 M&#x26;A). Compare it with the European market where the IPO number was 47 !!!! Read that again - <strong>47</strong></p>\n<p>The amount of funds raised by VC firms was 160% of 2004 fund-raising.
