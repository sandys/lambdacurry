Id is famous of course with wrenching out the last drop of juice out of graphics cards with its cutting edge graphics engines.  The last time, everyone upgraded their cards en-masse was when Doom3 came out : I would say nVidia is watching what direction this takes (what with everyone predicting the death of desktop gaming).</p>\n<p>Id is famous also for open-sourcing its engines, roughly 5 years after they come out (for e.g. the IoQuake3 open-sourced engine). It will be interesting to see how this gets affected.</p>\n<p>But ever since John Romero quit, Id didnt really have a story script to its games - like for example Valve with its superb Half Life franchise. The “Source” game engine was probably not as cutting edge as Doom3’s, but what a game!</p>\n<p>I hope they are able to deliver something really kickass and scary (I should probably plug for Penumbra: Dark Plague and oh-so-classic System Shock 2 here)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Id Software merges with Bethseda","date":"June 25, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-25-id-software-merges-with-bethseda/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-20-fud-alert-64-bit-os-does-not-use-twice-the-ram/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"FUD alert ! 64-bit OS does not use twice the RAM"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-28-google344912337f6fcf3b-html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"google344912337f6fcf3b.html"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
