To make them truly generic, I needed to deduce directory structure that I was sitting in.<br>\nOne of the things I had to do was to check for existence of a file or directory. Now since Makefiles have a different syntax than ordinary shell, compounded by the problem of interfacing with the *nix shell, it took me some time to figure out/learn how to do this.</p>\n<p>The syntax (for GNU make) is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ifeq (exists, $(shell [ -d directory_name ] ) &#x26;&#x26; echo exists )<br>\n$(warning hi… I did it)<br>\nendif</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first I tried to do</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ifeq (1, $(shell [ -d directory_name ] ) )<br>\n$(warning hi… I did it)<br>\nendif</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but this did’nt work, because the shell interface does not return a numeric status (atleast I think so). But in the syntax that works, by the power of logic, the “echo exists” will take place if and only if the “shell” command works.<br>\nErgo, I can check for directories.</p>\n<p>whew!!</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/software\">software</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"File and directory check in Makefile","date":"August 24, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-08-24-file-and-directory-check-in-makefile/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-08-19-is-eda-at-its-nadir/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is EDA at its nadir?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-08-28-getting-too-hot-to-handle/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting too hot to handle?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
