This comes on the heels of a similar <a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&#x26;px=MTMwODg\">discovery</a> by Phoronix that Ubuntu touch was using SurfaceFlinger under the covers as well as an announcement that Unity will be <a href=\"http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&#x26;px=MTMxNzM\">switching</a> to Qt/QML for its next version.</p>\n<p>I think investing in Mir is a poor move and Ubuntu seems to be all over the place. Most top end device SoC manufacturers will only release Android compatible binary drivers for a long time to come. Even if they go Linux, they will most likely stick to xorg compatible drivers (because the big enterprise Linux gorilla - Redhat - is still invested in Xorg).</p>\n<p>If one has already made significant investment in porting Ubuntu userspace to Android+Surfaceflinger (on touch) why would you <strong>NOT</strong> use that work and port it over to the desktop. There is significant opportunity for innovation on the Android stack and though Google would need a little pushing to allow Ubuntu as a special tech member, it can still be done.</p>\n<p>And here’s the most important reason of all - yesterday, I had to attend an important GoToMeeting. I used my Ubuntu desktop and clicked the link only to be faced with a “unsupported platform message”. I dont know why, but I decided to try it on my Android mobile device. I installed the GoToMeeting app - clicked on the email and in less than 2 minutes from the time I got the Linux-unsupported message, I was connected to my meeting.</p>\n<p>Android already has a huge, huge, HUGE ecosystem that works frikking well - why would you not want to leverage that ? Ubuntu is trying to pull an Opera Browser or a Bada here with its Mir announcement - and we all know how that panned out.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why Ubuntu should use Android Surfaceflinger instead of investing in Mir and pulling a \"Bada\" move","date":"March 05, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-03-05-why-ubuntu-should-use-android-surfaceflinger-instead-of-investing-in-mir-and-pulling-a-bada-move/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-02-21-why-the-ps4-is-going-to-be-dead-in-the-water/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why the PS4 is going to be dead in the water"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-03-16-hacking-the-sd960ixus110-for-scuba-photography-using-raw/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hacking the SD960/IXUS110 for scuba photography (using RAW)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
