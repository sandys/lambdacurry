I have separate home and root partitions to keep up with my ever changing base installs. As a force of habit (which comes from the Redhat 6.0 days, where you could not boot if the primary partition was not in the first 8GB), I create primary partitions for all my mounts.</p>\n<p>When Win7 started to be installed, I had 50 GB of unutilised space lying around in my HDD. What Win7 does is create two partitions  - one for the main install and another 100mb partition for recovery. Now partition table holds a maximum of 4 entries - which means if you want more than 4 partitions, you need to have an extended partition somewhere (with anything over 4 partitions under it).</p>\n<p>What Win7 does is <strong>silently,</strong> knock out one of the linux partitions from the partition table and creates two partitions for itself. It was catastrophic, because it knocked out my home folder. Now, I was not able to access my home partition, even by booting a linux livecd and using gparted.</p>\n<p>After a lot of googling, I found <a href=\"http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk\">Testdisk</a> - a truly excellent, open source partition recovery software that works on windows and linux.</p>\n<p>All I had to do is mark my home partition and write the partition table - this causes everything else to get screwed up (including my Win 7 partitions), but I was OK with that.</p>\n<p>The only way around is prevention - <strong>always install windows 7 on an extended partition if you have more than one OS on it.</strong> The next time around I installed Win7, I <strong>pre-created</strong> extended partitions using gparted and installed Win7 on the extended partitions - note that the Win7 installer does not give you any sort of partition manager (the way Linux does)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Windows 7 screws with your partitions","date":"October 07, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-07-windows-7-screws-with-your-partitions/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-21-all-hail-lucid-lynx/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"All hail Lucid Lynx !"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-10-government-loses-hundreds-of-millions-by-not-adopting-a-proven-open-source-solution/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Government loses hundreds of millions by not adopting a proven, open-source solution"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
