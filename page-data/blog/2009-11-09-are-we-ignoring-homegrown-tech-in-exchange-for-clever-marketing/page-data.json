Yet when I read about VillageNET - I was very underwhelmed. (Note: unfortunately, you will have to be a paid member to read anything about <a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1286569\">VillageNET</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lab has developed a low-cost wireless-mesh architecture that extends from a town over multiple hops to bring a broadband pipe to rural areas. The lab says it has managed to extend the wi-fi range by using “directional” antenna, commoditized wi-fi radios and novel software that minimizes interference and maximizes system performance.Calling it VillageNet, the lab is close to signing a memorandum of understanding with a Union government agency to start rolling it in rural areas, says Poosala. He is not willing to disclose the name of the agency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why do I feel this way?  <strong>AirJaldi</strong></p>\n<p>I have previously written about <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/airjaldi-cost-and-terrain-effective-wireless-solution-for-rural-communities/\">AirJaldi</a> - the low cost, innovative wireless network <strong>already implemented and in use</strong> at Dharamsala. It already enables thousands of computers (<a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/56\">2000 of them in 2007</a>) working over <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/106\">45 KM</a> radius using the Dharamsala Community Wireless Mesh Network.</p>\n<p>All this technology is free. There are no MoUs, no agreements, no revenue sharing.</p>\n<p>It is mutually beneficial - since if the government deploys the AirJaldi Mesh technology on a larger scale, the technology gets fine tuned such that the original creators are benefited.</p>\n<p>Note that I do not believe that vested interests are at play here - it is ignorance. The governmental body that makes all the decisions, can be easily reached by well-intentioned corporate bodies through good PR/Marketing.</p>\n<p>I just wish that the government pays attention to a group of brilliant scientists - who have created a living, breathing technology which is actually delivering benefit of ten of thousands of people.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Are we ignoring homegrown tech in exchange for clever marketing ?","date":"November 09, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-09-are-we-ignoring-homegrown-tech-in-exchange-for-clever-marketing/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-08-linux-and-the-quest-for-eye-candy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux and the Quest for Eye Candy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-15-open-source-voting-an-exploration-of-election-security-without-obscurity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Voting: an exploration of election security without obscurity"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
