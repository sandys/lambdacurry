I saw this recent <a href=\"http://blog.tridgell.net/?p=111\">article</a> about the lead programmers of the Samba project talking about how effective pair programming is for them. And of course, a whole bunch of <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ehqvx/samba_lead_despite_only_one_of_us_typing_at_a/\">reddit</a> comments dissing them.</p>\n<h4>The nature of the programmer</h4>\n<p>I think all programmers walk with a huge ego around them - and I think that is a good thing. People who think of their code as their jijutsu are some ofot t the most interesting people to learn from. But that ego goes with a fear of not being good enough - the classic adage of  ”<em>no matter how fast you are or how strong you are, there is always someone faster or stronger”</em>.</p>\n<p>And that affects productivity.</p>\n<p>It affects the way you think about problems, about code and about practices. Not that you should not have an opinion (and a strong one at that). But why not open yourself up to the opportunity that your opinion is wrong ?</p>\n<p>Its pretty much like asking a pretty girl out for a date - you are the pretty girl ;)  If you are convinced that no guy in dis town is interesting enough, you give up the opportunity to be seduced.</p>\n<p>And all code is, of course, poetry.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pair programming as a culture : my jijutsu vs yours","date":"December 08, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-12-08-pair-programming-as-a-culture-my-jijutsu-vs-yours/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/_vimrc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":".vimrc"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-12-20-dlink-des-3026-switch-web-configuration-and-reset-howto/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DLink DES 3026 switch web configuration and reset howto"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
