There is a nice little <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html?hi=joel\">article by Joel Spolsky</a> on the difference in font-rendering philosophies between Apple and Microsoft (I had <a href=\"http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/a-tale-of-freetype-and-apple/\">covered a key patent</a> that Freetype on Linux had disabled by default).</p>\n<p>P.S. for those in the Linux world, who want to use these fonts with Vim/Emacs, here’s a nice <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/installing-fonts-linux\">article</a> on how to install fonts (with and without administrator priveleges). Use the <strong><em>~/.fonts</em></strong> folder.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Best programming fonts","date":"May 10, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-05-10-best-programming-fonts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-04-23-building-ecl-on-win32-using-vs2005/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building ECL on Win32 using VS2005"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-05-29-thar-she-flows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thar she flows!!!!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
