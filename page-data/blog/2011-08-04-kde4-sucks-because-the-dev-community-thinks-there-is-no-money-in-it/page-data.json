And where does he migrate to ? XFCE4 .</p>\n<p>Not KDE.</p>\n<p>XFCE does not have all the nuts and bolts of other full blown desktop environments (Gnome and KDE) - yet the move is from Gnome to XFCE and not to KDE. Why is this you wonder ? Simple - KDE developers think that the environment is a playground for them to scratch their itch because, well… there’s no money in it anyway.</p>\n<p>So they go crazy with useless shit like Nepomuk, Akonadi, Strigi and all that shit. Here’s a thought - Linus is someone with a normal workload that exceeds most of everyone else’s. If he doesnt need the semantic desktop crap, well neither do I - and neither do millions of users out there.</p>\n<p>What we need (and are willing to pay for) is a fast, slim desktop environment with <strong>usable</strong>  network-manager, printing interfaces, scanners, multiple monitors (that is such a BIG, BIG necessity in the workplace), webcam and one… just one of the freaking browsers that I can use (Firefox or Chrome).</p>\n<p>So why does no one in KDE work on this stuff ? Because they dont think it matters from a financial point  of view - and I dont blame them. All the polishing in Gnome is funded by the Ubuntu and Fedora projects who put in a lot of resources to get useful stuff working. No one does that for KDE (atleast not in any significant way as compared to Gnome).</p>\n<p>However, there are thousands of people out there like me who will put in money (through Kickstarter or something) for a usable KDE desktop.</p>\n<p>Oh and while you are at it - please hire a professional UI designer and get rid of the awful looking theme.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"KDE4 sucks because the dev community thinks there is no money in it","date":"August 04, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-08-04-kde4-sucks-because-the-dev-community-thinks-there-is-no-money-in-it/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-07-08-john-carmack-talks-about-pocket-crysis-goodbye-nintendo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"John Carmack talks about pocket Crysis - goodbye Nintendo"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-08-08-easier-said-than-done-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Easier said than done #1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
