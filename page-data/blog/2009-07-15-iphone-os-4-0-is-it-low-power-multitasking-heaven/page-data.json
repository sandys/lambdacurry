What is the difference between iPhone OS and Android?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Android (or even Pre’s WebOS) is a multi-tasking operating system - which means you can check your email while Pandora’s music is playing in the background.</p>\n<p>You cannot do this with the iPhone .</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Err.. why?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Because Apple <em>claims</em> to have tested and <a href=\"http://www.theiphoneblog.com/2009/03/17/apple-announces-push-notification-services-iphone-30/http://www.theiphoneblog.com/2009/03/17/apple-announces-push-notification-services-iphone-30/\">found</a> that background tasks consume upto 80% more power.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. So what now?</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s an idea I have been having for a while now. It started when I started thinking about why are cloned Chinese phones not carrying Android. I mean you have phones with <a href=\"http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/05/htom88-a-phone-with-both-android-and-windows-mobile.html\">mock</a> Android UI, so why would’nt a clonephone manufacturer simply get Android on.</p>\n<p>I believe it is the power consumption.</p>\n<p>You see cloned phones suck in battery life anyway… atleast after the first few weeks anyway. But that’s OK - what else can you expect from a $100 phone. Now background apps should make that suck, so <strong>much much more.</strong></p>\n<p>Which is when I started thinking about even based multi-tasking. I had worked once on a sort of event based P2P in Java.</p>\n<p>So, let’s see.</p>\n<p>There are four basic types of background activities that a person might want :</p>\n<p>1. Sensor based: for example apps tracking changes in your GPS co-ordinates, orientation, etc.</p>\n<p>2. Communication based: for example, your bittorrent going on in the background, or a transfer via bluetooth.</p>\n<p>3. Media based: for example, your music playing in the background while you do something.</p>\n<p>4. Time based: for example, your insulin medication alarm kicking in every 3 hours.</p>\n<p>Things like, you having your word processor running in the background is actually useless - because you can save the current document state and reload it everytime you click on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Why not make three schedulers, where apps can register themselves and have pseudo multitasking.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, Pandora could simply register itself with the media-scheduler and it just provides the URI (full path, either remote or local, along with authentication information) along with the interval during which the scheduler has to invoke a callback (maybe one playlist has finished, should I loop back?). The actual playing is done by the OS and its codecs.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you could have a Lonely Planet app running in the background, which registers itself with the location-scheduler, so that a callback gets invoked at every 1-degree change in location.</p>\n<p>What this could potentially provide is a way for people to enjoy multi-tasking without paying the battery penalty.</p>\n<p>Of course, Apple and its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field\">RDF</a> have painted a very different picture in their <a href=\"http://www.unwiredview.com/2009/07/02/iphone-4-0-os-event-based-modes-intellingent-and-scheduled-communications/\">patent application</a> where all they have claimed is changes in response to ”<em>life events”</em> .. whatever they are.</p>\n<p>I believe that they have actually not patented a media-based event, like background playlists. Probably we should be looking at incorporating that into Android, as a fork - say AndroidLite. What could emerge is a low-powered, restricted multi-tasking OS which satisfies 90% of all consumer requirements.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone OS 4.0: is it low-power, multitasking heaven?","date":"July 15, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-15-iphone-os-4-0-is-it-low-power-multitasking-heaven/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-04-we-need-source-code-whetting-for-indias-e-voting-machines/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"We need source-code whetting for India's e-voting machines"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-15-open-source-can-make-life-cheaper-and-easier-for-the-govt-too/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open source can make life cheaper and easier for the govt too..."}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
