It is a name well known, apparently, to entrepreneurs and VC insiders alike. The <a href=\"http://www.mousedriver.com/newsletter/newsletter.htm\">Mousedriver Chronicles</a> are a series of newsletters written by two just-out-of-Wharton graduates - <a href=\"http://www.mousedriver.com/product/about.htm\">Kyle Harrison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mousedriver.com/product/about.htm\">John Lusk</a>. It was supposed to be a honest and humorous take on their life as first time entrepreneurs making… computer mouses shaped as golf drivers. These were the heady days of the dot com boom, when every fresh faced grad with an MBA was opening a portal (I would know some of them too). But these two grads built a company making a cool product, but without any dot-boom sexiness. The Mousedriver Chronicles is now available as a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205737/ref=nosim/mousedandplat-20\">book</a>, and the much hallowed Brad Feld has it on his read-recently list. All in all, a good read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[Business] Mousedriver chronicles","date":"January 26, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-26-business-mousedriver-chronicles/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-22-business-incidental-prices-software-and-degrees-of-freedom/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[Business] Incidental Prices, Software and Degrees-of-Freedom"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-29-business-the-new-art-of-bootstrapping/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[Business] The New Art of Bootstrapping"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
