Even the comments section of Bill’s post has one about someone who had to seek funding from out-of-area, to get a better deal.<br>\nProblem is, that in case initial investors dont invest in the startup, it is a warning flag for other VC’s. This way, a group of VC firms can armtwist a small company into giving it all up.<br>\nI’m curious as to how the Datapower guys handled it - did they tell Mobius Capital that they were trying to look for a better deal? What was it that they gave as explanation for not accepting the original investors term sheet?</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/vc\">vc</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/business\">business</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/startup\">startup</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When VC's turn evil","date":"October 23, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-10-23-when-vcs-turn-evil/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-10-22-explicit-construction-of-class-object-not-pointer-to-class-object/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Explicit construction of class object (not pointer to class object)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-10-24-bernankes-gonna-go-up-in-a-copter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bernanke's gonna go up in a 'copter"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
