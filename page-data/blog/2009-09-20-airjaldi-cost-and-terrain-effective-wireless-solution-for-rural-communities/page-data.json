Started by an Israeli spiritual immigrant and talented hacker - <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5631353\">Yahel Ben-David</a> - they have succeeded in establishing a monkey-proof, snow-proof wireless mesh network at an extremely low cost.</p>\n<p>For example, they have designed and created a <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/74\">dirt-cheap method</a> for long distance wi-fi (which ordinarily costs 10,000$) for 300 $. They have engaged with several high-profile open source hardware projects to provide royalty-free hardware and software for a <a href=\"http://rowetel.com/ucasterisk/\">Free Telephony Project</a> as part of a <a href=\"http://tibtec.org/?q=node/97\">poor-mans-voip</a> (for $10).</p>\n<p>Some of their projects have tried to solve fundamental communication infrastructure problems like the <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/69\">Jaldi Battery Charger</a>, which attempts to bridge the gap between bad power supply mains and the need to charge wifi router batteries.</p>\n<p>Though AirJaldi has been able to present to people like <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/76\">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</a>,  given talks at <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/71\">UC Berkeley</a>, won awards in <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/93\">Stockholm</a>, and generally set <a href=\"http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/106\">records</a> in mountainous network connectivity, it has not met with the sort of mammoth government support that it should.</p>\n<p>For example, a recent study released by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, mentions that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remote and far-flung areas, which are not possible to be covered with terrestrial technology, are planned to be covered with Digital Satellite Phone Terminals (DSPTs), said Kamat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This clearly shows the incumbent providers have no idea on how to deploy a 45 KM, 5 mbps network link on the mountains using volunteer resources. Imagine the connectivity, if AirJaldi’s open source, royalty free technology could be deployed in every far-flung rural sector.</p>\n<p>Of course, this does mean it will hurt the bottomlines of big-name hardware suppliers, but our country will be that much closer towards effectively competing against other Asian giants.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AirJaldi - cost and terrain effective, wireless solution for rural communities","date":"September 20, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-airjaldi-cost-and-terrain-effective-wireless-solution-for-rural-communities/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-indias-digital-and-internet-security-initiatives-possible-pitfalls/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"India's digital and internet security initiatives - possible pitfalls"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-secure-paperless-business-transaction-standard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Secure paperless business transaction standard"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
