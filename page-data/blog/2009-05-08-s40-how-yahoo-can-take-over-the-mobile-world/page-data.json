The problem with this story is that it is going to be restricted to the newer Series 60, v3 phones.</p>\n<p>However, there exists one platform in this world, that is largely ignored - even by its original creators. This is the Nokia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Series_40\">Series 40</a> platform - designed for midrange phones and is the world’s <a href=\"http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/platforms/s40/index.html\">most widely used</a> mobile platform.</p>\n<p>So, how do you take it over? Simple really. Buy Opera Software - create a lightweight Linux stack, prop it with a javascript based runtime (like Palm’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_webOS\">WebOS</a>), make it installable over USB and then… tie it with Yahoo’s web services by default. Release it as open-source, like Android and sit back.</p>\n<p>If I may say so, the most important aspect of such a move would involve typography - nothing jazzes up people more (though they do not realize it), as much as nice antialiased fonts. Which is why Google, got someone to create the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(font)\">Droid</a> fonts for their Android framework.</p>\n<p>There is a huge, untapped, largely-ignored customer base waiting to be taken over - the key is a sufficiently lightweight and jazzy looking mobile stack. If Carol Bartz wants to transform Yahoo - this is definitely one way to go about it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"S40: How Yahoo can take over the mobile world","date":"May 08, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-08-s40-how-yahoo-can-take-over-the-mobile-world/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-08-secure-hi-perf-small-footprint-os-for-our-babus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Secure hi-perf, small footprint OS for our babus"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-08-rapid-deployment-of-ipv6-a-case-study/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rapid deployment of IPV6 - a case study"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
