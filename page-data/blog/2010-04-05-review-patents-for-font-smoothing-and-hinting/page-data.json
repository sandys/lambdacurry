I have <a href=\"http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/a-tale-of-freetype-and-apple/\">written</a> about this <a href=\"http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/linux-and-the-quest-for-eye-candy/\">issue</a> before.</p>\n<p>The basic issue is that certain basic patents in font hinting are owned by Apple. Though it has been good to never pursue them against Freetype - the font rendering engine for Linux - it was still a contentious issue.</p>\n<p>However, now these patents could be expired - which does not mean Linux has to use these… but it removes roadblocks to leapfrog to advanced techniques based on these fundamental algorithms. This idea is submitted to Ubuntu for legal counsel to enable this to happen.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Review patents for font Smoothing and Hinting","date":"April 05, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-04-05-review-patents-for-font-smoothing-and-hinting/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-04-01-hey-nvidia-get-a-handle-on-lucid-lynxs-problems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"hey nVidia - get a handle on Lucid Lynx's problems"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-04-16-ubuntu-10-04-kde-prevents-me-from-even-logging-in/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu 10.04 KDE prevents me from even logging in"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
