So the usual way of using Git on windows would be to use Cygwin/msysgit.</p>\n<p>Well there are people who want to use Git, but dont want to use the *nix way of doing things.</p>\n<p>Jgit to the rescue - Jgit is a <strong>library</strong> which implements most of Git’s functionality (which effectively is modeled like filesystem). It is also used as a base for the Eclipse and Netbeans Git plugin.</p>\n<p>But there is another co-hosted project ﻿﻿<em>org.eclipse.jgit.pgm</em> which implements a command-line interface over Jgit. The way to use it is interesting.</p>\n<p>Download <em><a href=\"http://eclipse.org/jgit/download/\">jgit.sh</a>__.</em> yes the script… it has an embedded <em>org.eclipse.jgit.pgm</em> JAR library.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>java -cp jgit.sh   org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Main <command></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes - that’s not a typo. Use the script as the classpath. It works. It doesnt work exactly the same as the vanilla git - but damn close enough.</p>\n<p>Java is smarter than I thought.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using Git on Windows without any of the Cygwin/msysgit nonsense","date":"September 13, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-13-using-git-on-windows-without-any-of-the-cygwinmsysgit-nonsense/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-09-pressflow-or-drupal-on-ubuntu-10-04-and-later-with-nginx/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pressflow (or Drupal) on Ubuntu 10.04 and later .. with nginx, php-fpm and clean-urls"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-19-postgresql-9-0-goes-gold/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Postgresql 9.0 goes gold!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
