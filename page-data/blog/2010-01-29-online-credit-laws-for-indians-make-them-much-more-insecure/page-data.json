This was a misguided (but well intentioned effort) to make online transactions more secure for all Indians, who were shopping using their credit cards on the internet. This was revealed in a <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/187849/3d_secure_online_payment_system_not_secure_researchers_say.html\">new research paper</a> by security researchers at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n<p>However, due to the business practices of Visa and Mastercard, what is actually happening that this system allows the bank to push liability to the customer - in other words they can say “hey, only you knew the password.. and a fradulent transaction has taken place. We have done everything we can, so you pay up for the stolen credit card”.</p>\n<p>However, Verified by Visa or Securecode, does NOT enforce the password system to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\">phishing</a> safe or specified the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">connection strength</a> for secure transactions. This lets a person be fooled by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack\">spoofing</a> and there is no liability for the banks!</p>\n<p>Are there better solutions - yes. Visa/Mastercard can make it mandatory to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID\">authenticator</a> for all credit card transactions (<strong>Note:</strong> some banks in India provide this service, but this is only to log into the bank itself - <strong>not</strong> for any transactions).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Online credit laws for Indians, make them much more insecure","date":"January 29, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-01-29-online-credit-laws-for-indians-make-them-much-more-insecure/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-01-27-wikileaks-needs-your-help/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Wikileaks needs your help!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-01-30-32-bit-compile-on-64-bit-ubuntu-not-finding-stdc-libs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"32 bit compile on 64-bit ubuntu, not finding stdc++ libs"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
