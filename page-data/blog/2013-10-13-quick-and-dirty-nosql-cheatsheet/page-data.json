All checks and balances happen through revision numbers that means disk usage increases pretty fast (due to previous revision numbers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>needs periodic compaction to clean up.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cassandra</strong></p>\n<p>data-model_: _</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>key-value database   - not document-oriented database</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2GB column value. maximum number of cells in a single partition is 2 billion. however different partitions can be on different machines/vms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>replication and clustering:  Cassandra is aware of network topology and does cross-datacenter replication fairly robustly among all the nosql systems (<a href=\"http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/cluster_architecture/cluster_planning\">http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/cluster_architecture/cluster_planning</a>)</p>\n<p>Performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cassandra tends to sacrifice read performance in order to improve write performance. Because of the log structured design of Cassandra, a single row is spread across multiple sstables. Reading one row requires reading pieces from multiple sstables. However, this comes with a much, much higher fine tuning control on disk layout and data locality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cassandra also relies on OS page cache for caching the index entries.</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consistency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cassandra does not offer fully ACID-compliant transactions, however the cluster itself can audit success/failure. For example, if using a write consistency level of QUORUM with a replication factor of 3, Cassandra will send the write to 2 replicas. If the write fails on one of the replicas but succeeds on the other, Cassandra will report a write failure to the client. However, the write is not automatically rolled back on the other replica. However, your application does get to know the failure condition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are no locks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>no MVCC - Cassandra uses timestamps to determine the most recent update to a column. The timestamp is provided by the client application. The latest timestamp always wins when requesting data, so if multiple client sessions update the same columns in a row concurrently, the most recent update is the one that will eventually persist.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CAP tradeoffs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cassandra supports tuning between availability and consistency, and always gives you partition tolerance. Cassandra can be tuned to give you strong consistency in the CAP sense where data is made consistent across all the nodes in a distributed database cluster. A user can pick and choose on a per operation basis how many nodes must receive a DML command or respond to a SELECT query.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writes in Cassandra are durable. All writes to a replica node are recorded both in memory and in a commit log before they are acknowledged as a success. If a crash or server failure occurs before the memory tables are flushed to disk, the commit log is replayed on restart to recover any lost writes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quick and dirty NoSQL cheatsheet","date":"October 13, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-10-13-quick-and-dirty-nosql-cheatsheet/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-09-23-steamos-is-here-my-prediction-came-true/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SteamOS is here - my prediction came true"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-10-22-getting-a-fully-activated-windows-8-1-installed-on-virtualbox-and-the-crap-that-microsoft-puts-you-through/"},"frontmatter":{"title":" Getting a fully activated Windows 8.1 installed on VirtualBox - and the crap that Microsoft puts you through"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
