A total lack of governance accountability. And a legion of NGOs who have set it on themselves to bring about democratic reform.</p>\n<p>The one difference between governance and democratic reform in several first world countries and India is <strong>data.</strong> A very smart comment on an entrepreneurship blog once remarked - <em>measure everything and thus steer any discussion</em>. Nobody, repeat <strong>nobody</strong> has a hope in hell of taking one step towards democratic reform till you engineer the government to be more free flowing - in terms of information, processes, statistics, identification.</p>\n<p>A digital government is the foundation on which reform can take place.</p>\n<p>The job of this blog is very specific - I intend to propose and define architecture and processes which unblocks some of the kinks in the flow of governance information. It is not my job to comment upon policies - I hope and want to enable someone else to be able to do that, enabled by my digital government.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Viva La Revolución","date":"May 03, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-03-viva-la-revolucion/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-03-global-chip-sales-reverse-trend/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Global chip sales reverse trend"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-03-ubuntu-jaunty-904-and-sansa-players-howto-get-them-working-together/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04 and Sansa players - howto get them working together"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
