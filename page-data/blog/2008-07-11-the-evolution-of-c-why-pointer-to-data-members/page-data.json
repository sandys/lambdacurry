It is a superlative work on the design process behind (arguably) the most popular language on the planet.</p>\n<p>In one of the topics <strong>[13.11]</strong> I was confused by Stroustrup’s statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>pointers to data members have proven a useful way of expressing the layout of a C++ class in an implementation <strong>[Hübel</strong>, <strong>1992]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that particular reference goes to a university research paper :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>An implementation of a persistent store for C++ -</strong></em> <strong>Aarhus Universistet</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With nothing else to go on, I searched on the university site (yes. I dont speak danish. No - I’m not being stupid). When I could find nothing, I tried very hard to track the author down.</p>\n<p>Very, very hard.</p>\n<p>No trace whatsoever - except on LinkedIn (where I dont have an <em>InMail</em> account). Finally I found a posting in Danish on a .Net site. I registered myself (that is a long, long tale… and we shall not speak of it) and managed to send a message to Peter. Of course I had no hope of getting a reply.</p>\n<p>And then today, Peter replies back to me and sends me a <a href=\"ftp://ftp.daimi.au.dk/pub/stud/ludvig/aPersistentStoreForC++.ps.gz\">link</a> to the Gzipped postscript of the manuscript. Cool!</p>\n<p>Thanks Peter… I hope u dont mind me linking to a PDF version of the same [<a href=\"http://sandeep.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/ps.pdf\">An implementation of a persistent store for C++]</a></p>\n<p>P.S.: Why did’nt Google index this PostScript? does it have a problem with gzipped postscript?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The evolution of C++: Why pointer to data members","date":"July 11, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-07-11-the-evolution-of-c-why-pointer-to-data-members/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-07-11-_vimrc/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"_vimrc"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-07-11-powershell-config/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Powershell Config"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
