This is tech that the US wants someone to take off their hands … because they dont see themselves using it in the next 10-20 years. They are racing directly for fusion.</p>\n<p>China is leveraging this and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/02/02/doe-china-molten-salt-nuclear-reactor/\">getting the US</a> to help them with tech.</p>\n<p>We are doing some <a href=\"https://southasianvoices.org/indias-venture-into-molten-salt-reactors/\">hand-waving study in MSR</a> … but definitely not at the level of china. Not a billion dollars worth.</p>\n<p>The problem is, I think, commercial - India is being sold large conventional reactors for billions of dollars (which will anyways take 10 years to execute). Everybody wants to stop talk about this.\nPlus, NYT recently came up with an article about the necessity for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/opinion/to-slow-global-warming-we-need-nuclear-power.html\">nuclear power to curb global warming</a>. MSR is not nuclear energy like Fukushima or Chernobyl … but a very clean and safe alternative.</p>\n<p>The future is atomic power. But not conventional. For India - it has to MSR.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thorium is the future of energy in India","date":"January 09, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-01-09-thorium-is-the-future/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017-01-11-UPI-zero-digital-payments-without-phone/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UPI Zero - Digital Payments without Phone"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-12-17-testing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"testing"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
