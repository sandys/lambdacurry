Now that phone’s interface looks like crap and so I had to take it upon me to inject some chutzpah into it.</p>\n<p>First of all the default UI - what the treonauts (ha ha !!) call the Launcher. The best, coolest free launcher is ofcourse <a href=\"http://www.freewarepalm.com/utilities/ispinlauncher.shtml\">iSpin Lite 1.8</a> - looks like a WinXP interface, but that can be configured. Then I needed something to roll back my mistakes - an installer. After searchin and searching, till there was gnashing of teeth, I found <a href=\"http://mytreo.net/downloads/destaller-lite,554.html\">Destaller Lite</a>. This, in conjunction with (the most excellent) <a href=\"http://mytreo.net/downloads/filez,3.html\">Filez</a> lets me get on with my life. And of course, I needent even mention <a href=\"http://www.operamini.com/\">Opera Mini</a> without which <strong>no phone</strong> is complete (yes iPhone, I mean you). I am still on the lookout for a better call management software for the Treo.</p>\n<p>Did I mention this is all until <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(mobile_phone_platform)\">Android</a> comes sauntering along.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A short guide to a non-clunky Treo 650 (with oomph)","date":"April 10, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-04-10-a-short-guide-to-a-non-clunky-treo-650-with-oomph/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-03-31-multithreading-paradigms-windows-and-nix/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Multithreading paradigms: windows and *nix"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-04-23-building-ecl-on-win32-using-vs2005/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building ECL on Win32 using VS2005"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
