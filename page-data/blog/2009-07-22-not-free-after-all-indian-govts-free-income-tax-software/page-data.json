Why do this, when you can do the exact same thing using the <strong>legally free</strong> and opensource <a href=\"http://www.openoffice.org\">OpenOffice</a> . Not only that, OpenOffice works with XML right from the beginning, which means you can use OpenOffice macros much more effectively than Excel’s.</p>\n<p>Moreover, you have excellent <a href=\"http://www.pitonyak.org/AndrewMacro.pdf\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pitonyak.org/oo.php\">examples</a> and a well supported <a href=\"http://www.oooforum.org/\">community</a> around it. Moreover, other people have <a href=\"http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2009/01/16/openoffice-spreadsheet-template-for-filing-kvat-returns-ported-by-zyxware\">managed to port</a> quite a few of our own income-tax deptt’s forms to OpenOffice Spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>I am finding it hard to conceive that our government is expecting us to fork over a substantial amount of money (and on average, a month’s salary) in dollars for something that is as easily achieved using free and opensource tools.</p>\n<p>It is these issues which are restricting the spread of software and information technology to increase productivity in the govt.
