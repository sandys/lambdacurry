Chidambarams’ proposed <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5026688.cms\">Integrated Crime Tracking System</a> to link our police together. I believe that India has lacked a cohesive and comprehensive digital security initiative - which includes IT-enabling for our law enforcement as well as initiatives for cyber-terrorism and foreign incursion.</p>\n<p>I would like to draw Mr. Chidambaram’s attention towards a similar initiative launched by the US Govt. to modernise the FBI’s crime tracking system - called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Case_File\">Virtual Case File</a> - which <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701485.html\">failed miserably</a>, at a cost of $170 million to the US govt.</p>\n<p>Consider the <a href=\"http://csis.org/uscc\">US Cyber Challenge</a> - it is hosted by the US Govt to attract and hire the best security researchers and hackers out there.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The US Cyber Challenge is looking for 10,000 young Americans with the skills to fill the ranks of cyber security practitioners, researchers, and warriors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where is our security and talent going to come from?</p>\n<p>Hacking borders more on art, rather than science and most govt’s recognise this. For example, a <a href=\"http://www.darkgovernment.com/news/chinese-hacker-community/\">deep story</a> on China’s hacker community who periodically attack the US Govt sites (and defaced the Dalai Lama’s site) have tacit approval from the govt.</p>\n<p>China has the <strong><a href=\"http://www.zjpark.com/zjpark_en/zjgkjyq.aspx?id=28\">China Eastern Information Security Industry Park</a>,</strong> as well as Information Security schools in various colleges. What do we have ?</p>\n<p>The next round of border incursions are going to come in cyberspace, where the effects are going to be much more severe .. and 100% complete deniability. Do we have any infrastructure to prevent this? Why is it that I dont see the govt. trying to atleast attract the top talent for this.</p>\n<p>Security cannot be ensured by a govt. employee earning towards his pension - it is done so by top shot hackers who wear their patriotism on their sleeve. Where are our’s ?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"India's digital and internet security initiatives - possible pitfalls","date":"September 20, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-indias-digital-and-internet-security-initiatives-possible-pitfalls/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-secure-paperless-business-transaction-standard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Secure paperless business transaction standard"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-21-all-hail-lucid-lynx/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"All hail Lucid Lynx !"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
