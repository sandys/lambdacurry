Currently what Facebook’s Project Titan is doing, is <strong>inserting</strong> itself in my SMS, email, chat and is <strong>disregarding</strong> voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No I’m not one of those who claim that they dont/will never use Facebook and so on - but I fail to see the volcanic hype that Facebook’s new messaging platform is getting.</p>\n<p>You see there is no longer any distinction between email, chat and SMS for me - oh yes, arguably there is the realtime conversation aspect of chat, but the problem is <strong>I’m having too many of them simultaneously.</strong> For all intents and purposes, by the time I switch back from that other thread, my email has a reply, or my post has a comment… or my comment has a reply.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I no longer use SMS to communicate with my friends anymore. You see, SMS is inherently very spammy - in India atleast, I get atleast 30 SMSes each day for insurance offers, real estate deals, etc. There is an incredibly high chance that I miss out on SMSes, because I dont want to look at them. But my Twitter app on my Android phone notifies me of mentions/replies/DMs. That I do check instantly.</p>\n<p>Now facebook itself has an app on Android/iPhone - which isnt built for the same kind of messaging paradigm as my Twitter app (I dont get a notification for updates, etc.), but then again Facebook is a stream of information rather than directed messaging. That is precisely why I want it to consume everything, including my phone calls, etc and not send me status updates on SMS.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow if Google Voice (which does consume everything) manages to simply migrate my trust network - hook or crook - why would my life not totally become Google ? It has web, iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm, Nokia clients… plus some marginal voicemail features (missed status updates as voicemail?).</p>\n<p>Facebook is definitely a step in messaging, but it is definitely a step backward.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Facebook Messaging is less useful than Google Voice + trust","date":"November 16, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-11-16-facebook-messaging-google-voice-trust/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-11-10-esti2-cheap-mobile-based-privacy-conscious-venereal-disease-diagnostic-kit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"eSTI2: cheap, mobile based, privacy-conscious venereal disease diagnostic kit"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-11-18-third-party-libs-management-with-leiningen-in-clojure/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"third party libs management with leiningen in clojure"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
