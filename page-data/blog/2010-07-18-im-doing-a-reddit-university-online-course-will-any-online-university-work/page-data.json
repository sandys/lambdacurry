I believe that a university works because of the environment, fecund for learning and competition. Other students, etc. How do you build that kind of a support system, environment online</p>\n<p>I see a billion different online universities, e-learning courses about - unsurprisingly, most of them focus on differentiation through content. But none of them delves into the psychological basis of universities.</p>\n<p>What then is the solution ?</p>\n<p>A usual way of building interaction is through chat rooms - which end up being empty because of insufficient people. What I think online universities should do is change the offering - learning is free for everyone. All students (paid and unpaid) can talk freely with each other. But only paid students can talk to the instructor.</p>\n<p>Instructor questions get transposed to a stack-overflow kind of webapp, with karma points, badges and the like. That in turn is going to be used when an instructor is not around: in that case the student with the highest karma points get automagically voted up as the defacto instructor. If a student refuses, there is automatic karma point deduction and the mantle passes on to the next one in the ranking.</p>\n<p>How about a group centric view than a personal centric (as is the norm)? Most online educational institutions assume that the student knows what he is doing, so they have a list of his questions, answers, etc. But what is needed is a list of his friends/peers questions and answers right on the dashboard. Group over personal… in a way.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure what will finally work, but the way we are doing it now, is definitely not the way.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm doing a Reddit University online course: will any online university work?","date":"July 18, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-07-18-im-doing-a-reddit-university-online-course-will-any-online-university-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-07-07-ideas-from-osx-into-linux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ideas from OSX into Linux"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-07-25-cheap-radio-communicates-over-thousands-of-miles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cheap radio communicates over thousands of miles"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
