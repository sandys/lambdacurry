This helps bring under public scrutiny, a large part of fund allocation which frequently comes under discretionary authority and therefore does not have to be reported.</p>\n<p>In India, a large problem with Right-To-Information is that information is not available. This is because, deliberately or otherwise, a lot of intra-governmental workflows happen over paper with no electronic trails. This makes the RTI largely ineffectual.</p>\n<p>An architecture to get volunteers to convert paper-scan data into electronic form has to be very carefully designed - to take care of the malicious aspect of people trying to put incorrect values, for kicks or for personal benefit. Technologies like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA\">reCAPTCHA</a> have figured out how to account for trust in people and that can be capitalized upon here.</p>\n<p>Combined, all these technologies have the potential to take the Right-to-Information to new heights of govt. transparency.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Volunteer data mining of governmental data grants","date":"August 04, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-08-04-volunteer-data-mining-of-governmental-data-grants/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-31-sony-and-ps3-dumbness-redux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sony and PS3 dumbness: redux"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-08-05-googles-video-endgame-on2-acquisition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google's video endgame: On2 acquisition"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
