[This statement stands redacted after <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/752-libgit2-a-git-linkable-library\">news</a> of Github’s efforts to create libgit2. However, I still believe that Github can do more - offer more training videos for free, etc.]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Today, Git exists as a loose collection of scripts (perl and shell). There are three projects underway to make git, a bit more platform-agnostic. They are the <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\">jgit</a> project(for Java), <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/dulwich\">Dulwich</a> (for Python) and <a href=\"http://repo.or.cz/w/libgit2.git\">libgit2</a> in C.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If I had to pick one, I would pick the Jgit project. I have used (and <a href=\"http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/using-git-on-windows-without-any-of-the-cygwinmsysgit-nonsense/\">written</a>) about using the Jgit commandline tool as a replacement for vanilla git. It works quite well, but it does not let you checkout commits, merge, branch, etc. It is fast enough that I dont particularly miss any performance differences.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are way too many people who work on Windows - especially in the web development field. If they are at all to use git (and thereby open a whole new market for Github), these pieces of critical infrastructure must be in place. I dont understand why Github is not working towards this.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Secondly, I personally believe that Github needs to get a professionally created git tutorial (none better than <a href=\"http://peepcode.com/products/git\">Peepcode’s</a> video) and host it for free on its website. Basic marketing 101 - but what I see is that they are offering to train you for a consulting fee.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What Github is competing against is not private gitloite repositories, but enterprise providers like Perforce, etc. who have so much <a href=\"http://www.perforce.com/perforce/media_library/index.html\">multimedia</a> content, that it isnt funny.</strong></p>\n<p>It is hard for me to ask clients to get a Github account for their projects, because they cant figure out what it does.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bitbucket gets acquired: what next for git ?","date":"September 29, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-29-bitbucket-gets-acquired-what-next-for-git/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-29-ubuntu-is-sucking-more-and-more-will-pay-for-fixes-suspendresume-and-dual-monitor-issues/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu is sucking more and more (will pay for fixes..) : suspend/resume and dual monitor issues"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-09-30-ip-addresses-shortage-and-is-here-now-india-will-get-affected/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IP addresses shortage and is here now - India will get affected"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
