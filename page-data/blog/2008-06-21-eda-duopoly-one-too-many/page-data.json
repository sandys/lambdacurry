Not in the hypothetical, over-a-Heineken manner, but in a more Nash-equilibrium kind of a way.</p>\n<p>A very interesting financial engineering paper is <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/pse/psecon/2008-04.html\">Product innovation and imitation in a duopoly with differentiation by attributes</a>. It analyzes the interaction between a duopoly with competing products, where one firm has a greater number of <em>attributes</em>,  than the other. It considers the possibility that a competitor may try to imitate the product to drive sales. Given the realities of hi-tech industries and patent laws, what is interesting is Section 3.2 which deals with situations in which product imitation is impossible.</p>\n<p>Forgive my naive understanding, but here are the relevant parts reproduced:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… In the ﬁrst stage, each ﬁrm i selects speciﬁc attributes for its product…</p>\n<p>… This standard assumption (see for example Motta, 1993) means that it is more costly to improve a product which already possesses many speciﬁc attributes.</p>\n<p>…In the second stage, ﬁrms compete in prices. There exists a price Nash equilibrium if conditions (3.1) and (3.2) are veriﬁed. Equilibrium prices are given by (3.3) and (3.4) and proﬁts by (3.5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If my understanding is correct, then the projections are not entirely rosy - duopoly’s tend to gravitate towards competing on price rather than innovation in features.</p>\n<p><strong><Start arbitrary hypothesis></strong></p>\n<p>There are very few truly innovative products that appear on the horizon - maybe Avant! was one (I like to think that PowerPro is another). However, most innovations are incremental. Look at the acquisitions in the non-EDA space - they are not game changing per se, but cut-throat competition (in features, <strong>not in price</strong> - a story for another post) drives innovation and hunger for acquisitions. What I fear is, duopoly’s will tend to compete on price rather than on <em>attributes.</em></p>\n<p>Sramana gives a good/noble suggestion in one of her comments - <em>corporate venture capital</em>. Truly, well meaning for the industry and will help a lot too. Usually, it is the brilliant-yet-underappreciated guys in big companies who end up creating startups and this would go a long way towards that. It is a matter of fact with comapnies like Microsoft. I do not know, how massive a change in corporate mindset will be needed to get this going in EDA.</p>\n<p>But perhaps all these discussions will be moot - why do people underappreciate tools? Be it GCC or Design Compiler or any other compiler in any industry? It is basic belief that a human is better than a computer.</p>\n<p>” I dont <em><strong>really</strong></em> need that synthesis tool which promises to give a 10% improvement. I can innovate in the design itself and get that to happen”.  It is why ESL is being under-used: big design houses will simply choose to hire 3 more teams, working under their <strong>tried-and-trusted-design-process</strong> and get them to focus on power/timing/area and not worry about the correctness of ESL compilers.</p>\n<p>What this may lead to is what I have always believed - EDA will have to return to the folds of the mother-ship. As a captive unit within design/fab companies. I do not believe that the senior executives will mind that too much - it is far cooler and impactful  to be a senior executive  in Intel than in Cadence, though they might be getting paid the same.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x3C;/End arbitrary hypothesis></strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"EDA Duopoly: One too many?","date":"June 21, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-21-eda-duopoly-one-too-many/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-18-cadence-and-mentor-sitting-in-a-tree/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cadence and Mentor sitting in a tree...."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-07-11-powershell-config/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Powershell Config"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
