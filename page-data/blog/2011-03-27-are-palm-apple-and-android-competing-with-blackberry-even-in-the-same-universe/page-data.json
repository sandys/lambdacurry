The answer to the Blackberry question is more server-side than client-side.Here in India, I see most of the hip young crowd carrying Blackberrys. Note that unlocked, grey-market iPhones are available in India at not-too-deterring prices. But Blackberrys are defacto, and all you see people doing is message, message, message.</p>\n<p>We have some of the rock bottom rates on calls and SMS - yet you can buy a fixed-rate Blackberry messenger subscription at nearly every service provider in India which lets you do unlimited group messaging (irrespective of domestic or international). I <em>think</em> you can also group-message a certain number of multimedia items.</p>\n<p>Now that is something that not even Apple has cracked. The system is seamless.</p>\n<h2>Prediction for the consumer market</h2>\n<p>The only competition to Blackberry in the hip-messaging market will come with the Facebook phone which will seamlessly integrate the mobile angle to the Facebook Messaging platform.</p>\n<h2>Prediction for the enterprise market</h2>\n<p>R.I.M can only be broken by the final integration of Google Voice, Gizmo5, Slide/Disco and some form of video chat into Android. The notification-bar on Android is simply custom built for messaging notifications.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Are Palm, Apple and Android competing with Blackberry, even in the same universe ?","date":"March 27, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-03-27-are-palm-apple-and-android-competing-with-blackberry-even-in-the-same-universe/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-03-24-maven-jaxb-plugin-problems-in-your-maven-pom-xml/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"maven-jaxb-plugin problems in your maven pom.xml"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-04-06-a-philosophy-of-notifications-gnome-or-kde/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A philosophy of notifications - Gnome or KDE"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
