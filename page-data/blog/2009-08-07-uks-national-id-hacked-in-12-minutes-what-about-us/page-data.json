What is the solution then?</p>\n<p>I have maintained that bureaucrats <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/we-need-source-code-whetting-for-indias-e-voting-machines/\">dont understand software</a> and code - and I dont expect them to. I expect them to, instead, focus on making the best possible decision for the people. I believe that critical pieces of software infrastructure that affect every citizen must be available for public whetting and audit. I mean open sourcing the software (database related or the software running on the smart card).</p>\n<p>As always, the hope that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity\">obscurity leads to security is a false one</a>.  Any security that is established should be done through clear cryptographic techniques - of which source code is important to the extent that it follows the technique to the letter. The actual secret piece of the security is generated through a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_key\">key</a> which should not be revealed.</p>\n<p>An audit of the source code ensures that the developers have not missed out any glaring bugs and problems. Frequently companies sell snake-oil by claiming to have developed a new cryptographic protocol that is their proprietary technology. All such claims needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Cryptography is hard and good cryptography is even harder - which is why the US Govt. held <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process\">open competitions</a> to determine a new encryption standard.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This process won plaudits from the open <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography\" title=\"Cryptography\">cryptographic</a> community, and helped to increase confidence in the security of the winning algorithm from those who were suspicious of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29\" title=\"Backdoor (computing)\">backdoors</a> in the predecessor, DES.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My privacy is at stake here and I am extremely concerned about the process being followed for the same.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"UK's National ID hacked in 12 minutes: what about us?","date":"August 07, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-08-07-uks-national-id-hacked-in-12-minutes-what-about-us/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-08-05-googles-video-endgame-on2-acquisition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google's video endgame: On2 acquisition"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-08-14-free-and-accessible-education-infrastructure/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Free and accessible education infrastructure"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
