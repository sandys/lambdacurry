He says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While it is imporant to court developers and technologists in the sales process since they typically have to give the technical buy-off and can just as easily squash an opportunity, it is not a great and economical use of time to have your most expensive direct sales resources and sales engineers doing this. Enter the web and the open source movement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting. However, going through his post reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html\">another post</a> by software guru Joel Spolsky. In his article, Joel talks about <em>substitutes</em> and <em>complements</em>. For example, consider a graphics card by nVidia. The sales of this card will go up, when its <strong>complements</strong> (read computer games) become cheaper. What’s the point, you ask…</p>\n<p>Using the web as a platform for building community is well and good. But, what are the complements of a brand new product - nothing. For example, I could develop a device which connects my iPod to record my radio shows. Will it sell? I dont know..even though in itself it is a complement to iPod, I still have to create its own set of complements.</p>\n<p>Can I depend on the developer community to do it for me. Nope. There has to be a momentum, which has to be created by the creators. So for example, if I had used a hackable linux kernel in my device - I could write modules to compress the stream on the fly/encrypt it/broadcast it to multiple receivers. Can I <strong>now</strong> depend on the deveopers? That depends on how much you maintain the momentum.</p>\n<p>One of the best lessons I learnt from my Big Boss was “respond fast and release often”.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to a quote by Joel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>..when an economist considers price, they consider the total price, including some intangible things like the time it takes to set up, reeducate everyone, and convert existing processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Creating a web based community is well and good. But a community withers out fast if there is no training/support. Companies may think that they have a <em>cheap</em> medium of the internet for marketing/sales. But customers now expect faster and faster responsiveness to issues. That does add on to cost.</p>\n<p>The web can never equal an attentive salesman who can sense body language. Its what I have learnt from deploying applications at customer sites.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/software\">software</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/developer\">developer</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/opensource\">opensource</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[Business, Software] Developers, Open Source and Complements","date":"January 10, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-10-business-software-developers-open-source-and-complements/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-08-business-stanford-edcorner/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[Business] Stanford Edcorner"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-01-15-business-asia-cias-strategic-15-year-vision-document/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[Business, Asia] CIA's strategic 15-year vision document"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
