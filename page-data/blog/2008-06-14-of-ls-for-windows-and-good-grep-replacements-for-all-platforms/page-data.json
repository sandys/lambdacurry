It does not support several of the advanced “ls” options. However, it is a wee bit tricky to rerplace the built-in “ls” cmdlet with the <a href=\"http://utools.com/msls.asp\">msls</a> alternative.</p>\n<p>To do that,  you need to unzip msls (viz, ls.exe, grep.exe and dircolors.exe) into <em>c:\\windows\\system32</em> directory.</p>\n<p>Then add the following to your profile.ps1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$env:LS_OPTIONS = “-bhAC —more —color=auto —recent —streams” set-alias ls “C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ls.exe” -option allscope</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This will take care of setting the required options to get it to work.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a new grep alternative built on perl called <a href=\"http://petdance.com/ack/\">ack</a>. Built on perl, it does 95% of what perl does.</p>\n<p>Only problem?</p>\n<p>Its not in Python</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Of \"ls\" for windows and good Grep replacements (for all platforms)","date":"June 14, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-14-of-ls-for-windows-and-good-grep-replacements-for-all-platforms/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-10-how-to-vu-djvu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to vu DJVU"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-18-cadence-and-mentor-sitting-in-a-tree/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cadence and Mentor sitting in a tree...."}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
