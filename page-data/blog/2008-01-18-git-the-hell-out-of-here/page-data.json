This meant I needed to have <em>libcurl</em> installed.</p>\n<p>As it so happens, for some godforsaken reason, the libraries on Ubuntu are libcurl<strong>3</strong>   , which meant that I had to build my own.</p>\n<p>No problemo.</p>\n<p>Yet.. and I say this again - <strong>yet</strong>..  I was getting no http features built in. So what was happening?</p>\n<p>Well the GIT autoconf does not let you tell it where to look for libcurl : you think it does (with —with-curl=<path>), but it conveniently ignores it.</p>\n<p>So I do:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>setenv LDFLAGS “-L<pathto curl libs>”; setenv CFLAGS “-I<pathto curl headers>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All seemed to be going fine.. when it conks out in linking.</p>\n<p>What now?</p>\n<p>Ahh.. you need to hack the Makefile, where it helpfully mentions</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> # Define CURLDIR=/foo/bar if your curl header and library files are in # /foo/bar/include and /foo/bar/lib directories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why oh why.. cant u have a simple autoconf?</p>\n<p>Needless to say, after this - it worked.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GIT the hell out of here","date":"January 18, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-01-18-git-the-hell-out-of-here/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-01-03-a-tale-of-freetype-and-apple/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A tale of Freetype and Apple"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-02-09-what-did-you-say-uh-djvu/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What did you say?.. uh..
