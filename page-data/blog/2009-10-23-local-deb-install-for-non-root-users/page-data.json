Now they had released their package as a tar.gz and makefiles assumed all libraries to be available in the system library path.</p>\n<p>The most interesting discussion on why the developers <strong>dont</strong> want this functionality in is <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-465425.html\">here</a>. Frankly, I think the discussion is asinine - rather than discuss use cases on why I should not be given this functionality as a non-root user, why not make it simply easier. I mean even Windows does the right thing (since Vista) by incorporating <a href=\"http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/5584.aspx\">Folder Virtualization</a>.</p>\n<p>I think there are two choices to get around the system - <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot\">chroot/debootstrap</a> method or the <a href=\"http://www.csamuel.org/2007/11/29/installing-lacie-4l-lightscribe-software-on-amd64-ubuntudebian-systems\">fakeroot</a> method. These are quite useful to create a 32 bit toolchain on a 64 bit system as well (that is something that <a href=\"http://icculus.org/fatelf/\">FatELF</a> should take care of nicely! more about that later)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I did neither and  quickly converted the deb into tgz to work with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sudo apt-get install fakeroot alien</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">fakeroot alien -t something.deb</code></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Local deb install for non-root users","date":"October 23, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-23-local-deb-install-for-non-root-users/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-10-government-loses-hundreds-of-millions-by-not-adopting-a-proven-open-source-solution/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Government loses hundreds of millions by not adopting a proven, open-source solution"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-open-source-digital-votings-trustthevote-project/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Digital Voting's TrustTheVote project"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
