A democracy exchanges trust of one for the distrust of  many. The basic precept of democracy is that absolute power corrupts absolutely - and what is absolute power if not the ability to control thoughts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newdelhitimes.org/archives/2006/07/i_support_the_b.html\">Gaurav Bhatnagar</a> for instance has a well intentioned post</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was credible information that certain blogs were being used to pass on sensitive information amongst terrorists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right. Let us examine that again. There is a difference between <strong><em>propaganda</em></strong> and <strong><em>communication</em></strong> - and the government and the media has deliberately chosen to ignore that difference. Take for instance <a href=\"http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/zfone/index.html\">zfone</a> (end to end VOIP encryption), <a href=\"http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/22/1943210\">ScatterChat</a> (end to end chat encryption), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)\">Tor</a> (completely private network). Not to mention the multitude of <a href=\"http://blog.yasirmemon.com/wp2/nfblog/?p=25\">anonymizers.</a> This makes it very hard to believe that terrorists could be using ”<em>he’s sleeping with the fishes</em>” kind of a code on their blogs. Of course we need to trust the government when they say so right?</p>\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n<p>The problem with the whole fiasco is not that the government asked for some sites to be blocked - but that it would’nt reveal what sites to block. Now if one were to <em>actually look</em> at the <a href=\"http://censorship.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Sites_Banned\">list of sites</a> one would <a href=\"http://curiousgawker.blogspot.com/2006/07/incompetence-of-indian-government.html\">see</a> that there are some sites which are blocked for no reason at all: but it is entirely possible some bureaucrat did not do his/her homework.</p>\n<p>The problem with this approach is the Orwellian tendency to say ”<em>we know best. you better listen for your own good</em>”. Which means that the sites were not communication, but rather propaganda. Which is quite understandable - sites promoting hate crime, etc. are despicable. But as we see in <strong>this particular case</strong>, the sites had little to do with what the government claimed. It was entirely blatant and baseless. And the <a href=\"http://www.shivamvij.com/2006/07/somebody-must-have-blocked-some-sites-what-is-your-problem.html\">refusal to actually tell us</a> about it is what smacks of totalitarianism. If that is not Big Brother, then tell me what is.</p>\n<p>The advantage of the internet is that its the only medium that is <strong>two way, self regulated.</strong> Which means any propaganda can be rebutted. And more importantly, if you as a parent, sibling, friend know what is the content of the site that is so malicious, you can take proactive steps to prevent it - for blocking it technologically is next to impossible.</p>\n<p>Delhi Police has a recent notification for all cybercafe owners to maintain records of the people sending emails - tell me if the government is’nt going to use to intimidate those who question its policies, tell me that the government wont try to curb criticism, and I will give you a Right To Information and Accountability.</p>\n<p>The question, is not what was blocked. It was and always has been <strong>why.</strong> And if anyone tells you that you dont need to know, then they are lying.</p>\n<p>Democracies are based on distrust - and rightly so.
