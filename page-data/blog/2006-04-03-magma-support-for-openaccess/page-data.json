Magma <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=5BGFKARP4I13GQSNDBCCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleID=184417561\">supports</a> the Si2 OpenAccess format for inter-operability. Now this would be a non-issue except for one thing - Magma apparently has cool internal data structures to support its entire unified flow. And what’s more, these data structures are <a href=\"http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1092201\">patented</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I suppose this makes sense from a business perspective. Magma is’nt used across the entire design cycle. The front-end is dominated by the Big Three. And I suppose when big design firms ask you to read data in formats dumped by other tools, you’re gonna have to do it.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/eda\">eda</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Magma support for OpenAccess","date":"April 03, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2006-04-03-magma-support-for-openaccess/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2006-03-30-now-the-future-eda-in-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Now & the future - EDA in design"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2006-04-05-eda-wars-return-of-dfm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EDA Wars: Return of DFM"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
