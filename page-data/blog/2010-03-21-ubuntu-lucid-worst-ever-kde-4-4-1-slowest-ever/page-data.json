Cleaup of driver compatibilities and more out-of-the-box experiences with things like webcams, etc.</p>\n<p>Instead what we have is an OS with a weird unusable theme (<a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/532633/\">bug532633</a>), a lot of time and resources spent in beautifying and optimizing the boot-up screen/time (<a href=\"http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/21/\">idea 21</a>). KDE 4.4.1 takes up 450mb of RAM on startup, 100% CPU spent on the semantic desktop (doing fast indexing) and still the network-manager sucks. KDE’s user interface has weird interactions like the Cashew  and widgets (plasmoids) that take up a shit load of RAM. Moreover, if you disable expensive features like compositing in KDE, the desktop looks like shit - the reason being that the desktop rendering code gets polluted if proper handling of non-compositing is done.</p>\n<p>Has anyone on the dev team even used Windows 7 ? Why does Kubuntu (KDE Ubuntu) take up more resources on my machine than Win7 ? Already, Linux has a disadvantage on laptop battery life, compared to Win7 - but this is just absurd.</p>\n<p>People are moving towards using thin and light (and extremely underpowered) - and all I see on all support forums is advice to upgrade RAM.</p>\n<p>This is crap and I am extremely disappointed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu Lucid: worst ever, KDE 4.4.1: slowest ever","date":"March 21, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-03-21-ubuntu-lucid-worst-ever-kde-4-4-1-slowest-ever/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-03-18-ubuntu-brainstorms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ubuntu brainstorms"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-04-01-hey-nvidia-get-a-handle-on-lucid-lynxs-problems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"hey nVidia - get a handle on Lucid Lynx's problems"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
