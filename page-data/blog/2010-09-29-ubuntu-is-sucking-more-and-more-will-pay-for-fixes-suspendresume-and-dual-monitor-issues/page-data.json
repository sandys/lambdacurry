I have infact made an <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/568711/comments/105\">offer</a> to buy Amazon gift coupons for fixes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/568711\">Bug 568711</a> is particularly nasty : it targets suspend and resume behavior. The worst part is that it is <strong><em>confirmed</em> with a severity of medium</strong> and is currently <strong>unassigned</strong>. What is this -throw laptop users under a bus day ? It is things like this that is making Windows 7 more and more attractive as an alternative OS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/613628\">Bug 613628</a> affects my ability to use multiple monitors which is absolutely the way I work these days.
