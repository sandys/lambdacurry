For those of you who have resigned thyself to Microsoft Image Viewer’s mercy - this has always been salvation. I have been using IrfanView for very many years now, ever since I discovered that hitting “Enter” in Irfanview gives you a page-fit full-screen black-background automagically-resized view of your image: hitting “Space” takes you to the next image in the directory. Slideshows were never this cool.</p>\n<p>Anyway, installing the <a href=\"http://www.irfanview.com/plugins.htm\">plugin pack</a> for Irfanview also gives access to a very nice and usable DJVU viewer (for Windows atleast). Just hit “Ctrl Pg-Up” for next page in the DJVU document and “Ctrl Pg-Down” for previous page. Hitting “Enter” will you give you the same full-page hotness as I described before.</p>\n<p>I think that makes IrfanView, the best DJVU viewer/reader on Windows.</p>\n<p>Now, that’s a life saver. Keep the number of software to a minimum: Irfanview (for images), VLC player (for video), Foobar2000 (for audio + ripping - oh hell yeah!)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to vu DJVU","date":"June 10, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-10-how-to-vu-djvu/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-05-29-thar-she-flows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thar she flows!!!!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-06-14-of-ls-for-windows-and-good-grep-replacements-for-all-platforms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Of \"ls\" for windows and good Grep replacements (for all platforms)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
