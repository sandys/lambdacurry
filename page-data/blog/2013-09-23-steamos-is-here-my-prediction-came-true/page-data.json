That could potentially be used a foundation to build a desktop OS as well that could well disrupt the market.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the first casualty is already here. Welcome <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/nvidia-seeks-peace-with-linux-pledges-help-on-open-source-driver/\">nVidia </a>- they have begun to work with the Nouveau open source graphics drivers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NVIDIA is releasing public documentation on certain aspects of our GPUs, with the intent to address areas that impact the out-of-the-box usability of NVIDIA GPUs with Nouveau. We intend to provide more documentation over time, and guidance in additional areas as we are able.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"SteamOS is here - my prediction came true","date":"September 23, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-09-23-steamos-is-here-my-prediction-came-true/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-08-13-creatine-important-diet-vegetarian/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"If you&#8217;re on a vegetarian diet, please supplement with Creatine"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-10-13-quick-and-dirty-nosql-cheatsheet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quick and dirty NoSQL cheatsheet"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
