Why is this important at all? Look at the current functioning of any government branch - information is locked up in proprietary formats like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, or even if saved in plain text, are lying rotting in some hard disk .. on a desktop or a server. There is no easy way to search it and there is no <strong>standard</strong> (re-emphasize ”<em>standard”)</em> way of sharing it between different stakeholders - for example intelligence authorities, police, ministers, port authorities, etc. Of course, the complexity of the entire affair has to be considered as well - not everyone has the same access to information, some information has to be restricted, etc.</p>\n<p>All these issues were present in 2001, when 9-11 happened and the United States government came up with technological measures to ensure information flow through the right channels.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the specifications for the data-format, deals solely with <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/pdf/ISE-FS-200_ISE-SAR_Functional_Standard_V1_5_Issued.pdf\">Suspicious Activity Reporting</a>. Another specifies <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/niem-2/niem/have/2.0/have.xsd\">Hospital Availability Exchange</a> (invaluable for aftermath of a terrorism incident), <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/niem-2/niem/domains/immigration/2.0/immigration.xsd\">Immigration</a> data, <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/niem-2/niem/twpdes/2.0/twpdes.xsd\">Terrorist Watchlist Person Data Exchange Standard</a>. In fact there are a load of standardised specifications for specific data exchange <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/niem-2/niem/index.html\">requirements</a> (also available as an <a href=\"http://www.niem.gov/niem-2/niem/niem-2.0.xls\">Excel sheet</a>).</p>\n<p>The advantage of having standardised schemas for <strong>information storage and retrieval</strong>, is so that a lot of tools can be developed for these standardised and used anywhere. What it does is enable collaboration on a national and international scale for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>One can develop a billion different software algorithms for mining data, to figure out terrorist probability, etc. - but they are all useless until the many different databases in which information is contained are tied together. This will only happen if  the data format is standardised.</p>\n<p>But what about legacy (pre-existing) data? the answer is to convert them into the newer format - it can be done very cheaply using open source tools like Python, Lisp (with its STP package to manipulate XML), etc.</p>\n<p>Mr. P Chidambaram, it is not enough to institute a National Investigative Agency, you need to make sure the tools needed to fight crime have been migrated to this century. In a world where criminals use encryption tools, it is beyond paramount to ensure that the bureaucracy are dragged, kicking and screaming, into putting in place technology to make this country safer.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Indian Law-enforcement information exchange: the post 26/11 scenario","date":"June 03, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-03-indian-law-enforcement-information-exchange-the-post-2611-scenario/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-30-reliable-e-voting-systems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reliable E-voting systems"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-11-quickfix-for-your-linux-cddvd-writer-errors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quickfix for your linux CD/DVD writer errors"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
