In case, you follow a difficult set of steps, you come at the only standard which has been published:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://stqc.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkfile/File1003.pdf\">Institutional mechanism for e-Governance Standards formulation version 1.0</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is, of course, a standard to make e-governance standards!</p>\n<p>This is highly delplorable considering that this covers areas like Information Security and Cryptographic standards. <a href=\"http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/post/security_through_obscurity/\">Security through obscurity</a> never works.</p>\n<p>Consider the way that cryptographic standards are set in the USA, which takes place through its parent body - <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/index.html\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>. It makes its publications available online at its <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/srd/\">portal</a> in a very transparent, searchable manner. But that is not the best part :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It publishes all its <a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsDrafts.html\">drafts</a>.</li>\n<li>For determination of cryptographic and information security standards, it uses a <strong>public competition and peer review process,</strong> during which, academics and professionals compete to come up with the best cryptographic standard. One such competition is <a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html\">underway</a> to determine the next version of the digital hashing standard, a key piece for the e-commerce industry. Previously, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\">AES standard</a> for cryptography came from arelatively unknown researcher, who beat stalwarts like Shamir and Rivest for the win.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only is India’s method highly bureaucratic, it is extremely scary, considering most of information security malpractices stem from insiders. It is not a bad idea to mirror the American cryptographic standards, if we do not have the resources to pull off a competition.</p>\n<p>Babu-inspired cryptography is something to be afraid of - I guess it is time to file a Right-to-Information petition for the release of these standards.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"India's e-governance standards: information withheld","date":"May 12, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-12-indias-e-governance-standards-information-withheld/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-09-security-protocol-for-an-india-wide-national-id/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Security protocol for an India-wide national ID"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-05-14-ati-ixp-ad1981b-thinkpad-r51e-sound-on-jaunty/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ATI IXP AD1981B (Thinkpad R51e) sound on Jaunty"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
