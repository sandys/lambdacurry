This means that a stock install of zsh is going to suck and one wonders what were all those guys smoking when they had simultaneous moments of ecstasy while using zsh.</p>\n<p>Yet, Being able to type gcc -[TAB] to see a list of its command line options is something that most users could never imagine in other shells.</p>\n<p>I have my own <a href=\"http://sandeep.wordpress.com/zshrc/\">zshrc</a> here - this is the same config file that I have contributed to <a href=\"http://www.slitaz.org/en/\">Slitaz</a> (which by the way is an entire linux distro with wireless and everything in 25 mb).
