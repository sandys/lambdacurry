I think of the serious advantage that Indian intelligence agencies will derive, in their fight against terrorism and really hope that something like this gets put in place.</p>\n<p>I have been looking at <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop</a> and it is being used in production for the Yahoo search engine as well as its <a href=\"http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/\">database</a> needs. This free and open-source technology allows us to buy really cheap, commodity hardware and use it for really complex data mining queries - which can be in any format. Integration of technologies like <a href=\"http://xml.coverpages.org/saml.html\">SAML</a>, will allow fine-grained access control to secure any highly sensitive data. However, the most important advantage will be unifying all the different database/file stores etc. that various security agencies use and therefore help in connecting the dots.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/cloud-saas/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218501405\">http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/cloud-saas/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218501405</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Collaborative, cheap, secure and fast National Intelligence data mining","date":"July 23, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-23-collaborative-cheap-secure-and-fast-national-intelligence-data-mining/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-23-zappos-sells-to-amazon-did-the-vcs-force-their-hand/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Zappos sells to Amazon: did the VC's force their hand"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-30-crowdsourcing-eda-manual-generation-of-test-vectors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Crowdsourcing EDA: manual generation of test-vectors"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
