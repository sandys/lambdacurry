It is a very interesting architecture (not unlike on-demand cloud computing technology put in place by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC2\">Amazon’s EC2</a> ).</p>\n<p>It primarily allows any user to provision (which means request and reserve) a remote computing resource, configured as per his/her choice. For the layman, it sounds pointless.. but consider an example.</p>\n<p>You want to run a search for criminals that takes 2-3 hours to run - how do you do it? Now imagine, there are thousands of other similar users, all wanting to do something equally resource-consuming (not necessarily search). One way is the unsophisticated way of running it anyways and completely bogging down the system.</p>\n<p>The second way is putting in a manual request for computer time - this of course is subject to the administrator’s availability</p>\n<p>Also consider the situation where everyone is on holiday - or some people are on holiday. How do you manage computing resources, so that they do not sit idle and drink useless electricity?</p>\n<p>The answer is an automatic provisioning system, where you can request for .. say a computing resource with Microsoft Word. Once your request is granted, you can connect to this computing resource (using technologies like RemoteDesktop, VNC, ssh , etc.) and can remotely work on it. After you are done, you <em>release</em> the resource, so it can potentially be used for someone else.</p>\n<p>This architecture has the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you dont need expensive and powerful computers everywhere - just need a simple computer and a decent network connection.</li>\n<li>you dont need expensive software everywhere - most software companies have special licenses to allow a lot of users connect to these on-demand resources (e.g. Microsoft’s <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/3/B/D3BDC684-7A7A-4847-9A8C-4A4C8907C38E/VECD_Licensing_Guide_English_090208.pdf\">VECD</a>)</li>\n<li>you dont need to bother hiring, training and managing IT administrators everywhere.</li>\n<li>employees cannot make excuses about software/hardware being unavailable. At the very least, they can work out of a cyber-cafe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you consider the Indian context, you can see how each state could deploy it’s own <em>cloud</em> and simplify its own IT architecture.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud Computing : RACE to information preparedness","date":"December 05, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-12-05-cloud-computing-race-to-information-preparedness/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-12-05-wbemtest-like-functionality-in-linux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"wbemtest like functionality in Linux"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-12-05-a-cheap-reliable-fileserver-with-features-similar-to-commercial-offerings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A cheap, reliable fileserver with features similar to commercial offerings"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
