This in turn means that they are similar to arrays.<br>\nNow, heapsort will perform with O(n log(n) ) upper-bounded complexity. But, if the array like structure is enforced, it will be very easy to map it to a similar heap structure (just re-ordering). Which means that heapsort may have better cache-performance than, say quicksort (cos the temporary space required is inside the orginal array heap).<br>\nJust a thought.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/eda\">eda</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/personal\">personal</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/software\">software</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Does heapsort make more sense for EDA algorithms ?","date":"September 29, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-09-29-does-heapsort-make-more-sense-for-eda-algorithms/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-09-25-prediction-markets-real-life-psychohistory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prediction markets: real life psychohistory?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-09-30-delhi-half-marathon-training-week-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Delhi Half Marathon Training: Week 1"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
