This guide assumes you are starting from Linux - this is reasonably guaranteed to work. The only case where it might not work is if Gparted was unable to set boot flags on your particular brand of USB drive.</p>\n<p>You need to install GParted on your machine, download and compile <a href=\"http://ms-sys.sourceforge.net/#Download\">ms-sys</a>. At this point, plug in your USB disk and launch Gparted (using ’<em>sudo gparted</em>’) to check which partition it is mounted in. You could also type ’<em>mounts</em>’ on your command line to see this information. In my case, it was mounted at <em>/dev/sdb1</em>. Format it as NTFS and set the boot flag to 1.</p>\n<p>Now mount your win7 installation ISO - using ‘﻿<em>sudo mount -o loop win7.iso /mnt/iso</em>’ (I assume you have created a directory called <em>/mnt/iso</em> beforehand) and copy ALL the files in the ISO to your USB drive.</p>\n<p>Compile <em>ms-sys</em> , unmount the USB drive (using <em>sudo</em> <em>umount /dev/sdb1</em>) and execute</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sudo ms-sys -7 /dev/sdX</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s it!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The definitive guide to creating a bootable USB installer for Windows 7 (any flavor)","date":"June 12, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2010-06-12-the-definitive-guide-to-creating-a-bootable-usb-installer-for-windows-7-any-flavor/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-05-26-fedora-already-using-btrfs-snapshots-for-enterprises/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fedora already using BTRFS snapshots for enterprises ?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2010-06-15-script-fu-copy-and-create-destination-dir-if-it-does-not-exist-in-linux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"script-fu: copy and create destination dir if it does not exist in linux"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
