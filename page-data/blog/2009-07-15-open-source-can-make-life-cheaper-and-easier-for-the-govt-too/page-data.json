The New York city govt. had the choice to buy expensive Windows licenses + heavy duty computers + antivirus … vs cheap typewriters - it went with typewriters. It may be that typewriters ensure paper wastage, time-wastage (manual spellcheck) and is error-prone.</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised if the Indian govt. made these kind of decisions - a third world country has to make its dollar go much further than the U.S.</p>\n<p>However, there is a much better alternative.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.pmptoday.com/2009/06/25/coby-nb-pc1022-the-cheapest-10-inch-netbook-at-240/\">240$ netbook</a> (I’m sure much cheaper in bulk) + Linux based OS (<a href=\"http://www.canonical.com/netbooks\">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a> or the ultra fast <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moblin\">Moblin</a> / <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFJaDy6ySbU\">Clutter</a>) with OpenOffice or AbiWord as word-processors. What you get is a very cheap and powerful word-processor which increases productivity, many-fold. And it is virus-free as well (so no extra hidden costs). Hook up a heavy duty network printer and you save enough paper (and correction whitener), not to mention time to make up for it.</p>\n<p>It doesnt matter how hard you hit the keys of the netbook, because replacement keyboards cost 10$ at retail - I’m sure it would be much cheaper in bulk.</p>\n<p>I believe that computers have gotten to the price-point where it would be senseless to give up this productivity  increase  and paper savings in exchange for negligible savings in upfront cost.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Open source can make life cheaper and easier for the govt too...","date":"July 15, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-15-open-source-can-make-life-cheaper-and-easier-for-the-govt-too/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-15-iphone-os-4-0-is-it-low-power-multitasking-heaven/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone OS 4.0: is it low-power, multitasking heaven?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-07-17-nandan-nilekani-doesnt-have-an-email-id-is-this-infosys-pace/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nandan Nilekani doesnt have an email ID: is this technological red tape?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
