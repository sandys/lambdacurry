I dont know what was the underlying technology that they tried to use, but it is heartening to know that multi processing/threading, does have a few champions left in EDA.</p>\n<p>Looking at the non-EDA enterprise world, I see the shift towards trying to capitalize as much processor real estate as possible. Take for instance <em>virtualization -</em> it exists simply because people want to save money and power by running two operating systems on the same physical <strong>box</strong>, yet keep them separate (IP address, hardware ID, etc.) Probably, the problem space allows you to scale in that way - which EDA does not.</p>\n<p>EDA is one of the most processor hungry software I know of. Yet, it is not capitalizing and scaling with multiple processors. It will be a darn shame if we are going to use only one of Intel <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrabee_(GPU)\" title=\"Wikipedia entry about Larrabee\">Larrabee’s</a> cores, when it hits the market (<strong>P.S.</strong> nVidia vs Intel will be fun to watch)</p>\n<p>EDA will have to move to these computing systems, but the question is still open, on whether C++ (the traditional turf of EDA) will capture the flag, or will it be some other language. </p>\n<p>Note that the advantage of manual memory management loses its sheen when compared to the raw brawn of 16 cores.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Liar Liar at the DAC","date":"September 20, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-09-20-liar-liar-at-the-dac/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-09-13-laptop-bags-why-so-bad/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Laptop bags - why so bad?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-09-26-distributed-eda-sharing-some-cpu-love/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Distributed EDA: sharing some CPU love"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
