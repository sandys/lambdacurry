In a terse two-page letter Smith also argued the voting machine software is a Sequoia trade secret and cannot be handed over to any third party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all I think this is a huge credit for Sequoia and something that should be followed by every government contractor in India or abroad. Every argument relies on the software vendor being the ultimate authority and trust of the software that governs our voting systems - be it <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/we-need-source-code-whetting-for-indias-e-voting-machines/\">general elections</a> or <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/10/27/dda-allotment-software-scam-and-audit/\">housing plans</a> or even the <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/08/07/uks-national-id-hacked-in-12-minutes-what-about-us/\">National</a> ID <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/an-open-letter-to-nandan-nilekani-and-the-universal-id-project/\">Project</a>. As citizens, we need to understand that we should be able to have as much confidence in our governance software as its processes.</p>\n<p><strong>The Right To Information should have source code as part of it.</strong></p>\n<p>A game software, for which you have the freedom of choice to purchase, is something that you can live without having the source code. As is demonstrated by Sequoia - open source is the <strong>only</strong> way to have confidence in governance software which millions <strong>have to use</strong> without any choice.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First wicket: Sequoia Voting Systems open-sources its software","date":"October 29, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-29-first-wicket-sequoia-voting-systems-open-sources-its-software/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-dda-allotment-software-scam-and-audit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DDA allotment software - scam and audit"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-08-linux-and-the-quest-for-eye-candy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux and the Quest for Eye Candy"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
