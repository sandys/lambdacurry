And then I see this <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/15/nvidia-announces-quad-core-kal-el-soc-promises-it-in-tablets-by/\">article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A 2560 x 1440 stream was being decoded on a developmental device, scaled down to that slate’s native 1366 x 768 resolution, and additionally displayed on a connected 30-inch, 2560 x 1600 monitor. That entire voluminous workload was being handled in real time by Kal-El and we saw no signs of it struggling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Forget about all the fucking dual monitor madness - this is not where the market is.</p>\n<p>Give me <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis_2\">Crysis 2</a> on my Tegra phone which I can connect to my monitor and play at 1080P. Do you have any idea how much that shit will sell ? I would gladly pay upto a thousand dollars (with the shitty exchange rate) for that. Hell, I’ll pay that much for a 720P capability.</p>\n<p>Am rooting for you nVidia - heaven knows you need it. I cant throw a stone without hitting an AMD/ATI setup.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When can I have some Crysis love on my quad-core Tegra Android phone ?","date":"February 17, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-02-17-when-can-i-have-some-crysis-love-on-my-quad-core-tegra-android-phone/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-02-15-is-boxbe-the-most-idiotic-service-you-can-sign-up-for/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is Boxbe the most idiotic service you can sign up for ?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-03-18-dell-inspiron-14r-and-14r-support-8gb-rather-atleast-6gb/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dell Inspiron 14R and 14R support 8GB (rather...atleast 6GB)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
