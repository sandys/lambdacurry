Inappropriately uses static stretching after warm-ups for plyometric-based workouts.</p>\n<p>Dr. Donald Chu, a leader in plyometric training and research, has long suggested that appropriate plyometric volumes for athletes should be based upon training experience and intensity, and determined by the number of foot or upper-extremity contacts. While most of Insanity’s drills qualify as low-to-moderate intensity drills, the number of foot contacts featured in several sessions is almost double the number suggested by Chu, which raises concerns about repetitive micro-trauma or overuse.</p>\n<p>Beachbody’s business model relies significantly upon income generated through their supplement line, and both the P90X and Insanity programs prominently feature supplement sales.</p>\n<p><strong>P90X –</strong> Emphasizes almost all parameters of fitness</p>\n<p>Sound flexibility programming</p>\n<p>Science-based design and progression, follows traditional split routines, becomes repetitive in Block 3</p>\n<p>Good use of active recoveries and muscle-group recoveries between sessions;</p>\n<p>solid plyometic design and work-to-recovery ratios</p>\n<p>Nice combination of general movements, progressing by building complexity and intensity</p>\n<p>Utilizes both dynamic movements and some static stretching (not bad if it complements dynamic movements). Confuses explanation between ballistic and dynamic movement</p>\n<p>As with Insanity, exercisers are frequently asked to monitor heart rate (HR), and check target HR zones, but little explanation is offered for why this is necessary. While there is an initial cardio test that measures recovery HR, no information or explanation is offered in the program regarding target HR zones or appropriate HR training intensities.Unfortunately, one disappointing aspect of P90X is the need to make a considerable investment into ancillary equipment to complete the workouts.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Comparison of popular home fitness programs &#8211; Insanity, P90X and Rushfit","date":"July 29, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-07-29-Comparison-home-fitness-Insanity-P90X-Rushfit/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-07-24-how-to-think-about-web-services-apis/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to think about web services APIs - REST and SOAP"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-07-29-learn-how-to-deadlift-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learn how to deadlift &#8211; step by step guide for beginners"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
