Which means that the people of South Korea do not have choice in using the safer browsers (Firefox, Chrome) or other operating systems (Linux, Apple Mac).</p>\n<p>Every citizen, no matter how poor, needs to pay for a license of Windows - unless he/she wants to stay away from using the govt’s websites, bank websites, etc.</p>\n<p>It all happened because of a <a href=\"http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archive/2007/01/26/00h53m55s#003095\">choice</a> the govt made - to develop a non-standard encryption standard called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEED\">SEED</a>. Adhering to the technology choices of that time, the govt. developed a ActiveX <a href=\"http://webstandard.or.kr/en/?p=10\">plugin</a> that was made <a href=\"http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2008/07/activex-law-in-korea.html\">mandatory</a> for any kind of secure access (for example to bank websites, etc.).</p>\n<p>The world moved forward - ActiveX as a technology was found to be a significant security risk. However, South Korea remained to be stuck to its old technology. The situation became so bad that the govt. <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200701/200701240013.html\">advised</a> its citizens against using Microsoft Vista, because the ActiveX plugin would not work on it.</p>\n<p>In the first week of October this year, a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478839\">patch</a> was added to Mozilla Firefox (by volunteers of Mozilla along with employees of Korea’s govt. agency) that <strong>may or may not</strong> work in actual practice.</p>\n<p>What has this got to do with India ?</p>\n<p>We do the exact same thing.</p>\n<p>As I have written before, we have a few similar issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the digital certificate registration site is <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/05/09/digital-certificates-and-identity-management-in-the-indian-govt/\">only usable</a> using Internet Explorer (rather than a standardized system accessible to all browsers)</li>\n<li>Income Tax deptt’s site <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/cryptographic-usage-on-indian-govt-websites-why-the-java-fetish/\">uses a proprietary</a> Java plugin for certificate upload (rather than use free plugins for browsers like Firefox)</li>\n<li>Income Tax deptt’s <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/not-free-after-all-indian-govts-free-income-tax-software/\">tax calculation tools</a> are all in Microsoft Excel (which costs Rs 20000), rather than the free OpenOffice format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We need to get rid of such lock-in immediately - or the <em>aam aadmi</em> will need to shell out a month’s salary to calculate his income tax.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How a country's IT infrastructure is held hostage","date":"October 27, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-how-a-countrys-it-infrastructure-is-held-hostage/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-open-source-digital-votings-trustthevote-project/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Digital Voting's TrustTheVote project"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-10-27-doom3-engine-vs-bioshock-unreal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Doom3 engine vs Bioshock (unreal)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
