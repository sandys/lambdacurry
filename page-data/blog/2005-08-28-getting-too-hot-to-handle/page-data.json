Besides the perfunctory presentation on Moore’s Law, it seems a focus was on power vs performance this time, especially by Intel. For example, Intel launched the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&#x26;ct=res&#x26;cd=2&#x26;url=http%3A//www.intel.com/personal/desktop/viiv/&#x26;ei=dVURQ-uwIoHsYPyp8LMJ\">Viiv</a> platform, which is based on media-centric non-form factor devices. It essentially means chipsets which can perform tasks ranging from plain vanilla web surfing to computing intensive gaming, all taking place under the hood of a variety of form factors.</p>\n<p>Form factors.</p>\n<p>That is the key difference here. For this to be able to accomodate a variety of form factors, it essential to conquer the power problem. Enter William Holt and Intel.</p>\n<p>It has been common knowledge that leakage power and interconnect losses are dominating current chip manufacturing technology generations. From a manufacturing point of view, they are trying new and funky things like high-K dielectric substrates and the new horse in the fab stable (in my opinion) - <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011203S0068\">silicon on nothing</a>. This would also cause changes in design methodologies - especially at routing (maybe a problem that companies like <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=169400764\">Teraroute</a> could solve) and in timing closure. For example, as Tets Maniwa points out, designing with multiple voltage islands is not a simple task. Current design methodologies are limited because of the extensive use of wireload models - these may be inaccurate in the face of dramatic on-chip variation (as is the case with voltage islands). This may require multiple respins of place and route to achieve accurate enough back-annotation of interconnect delays and suitable timing closure.</p>\n<p>All in all, its an interesting world we live in.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/eda\">eda</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/business\">business</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting too hot to handle?","date":"August 28, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-08-28-getting-too-hot-to-handle/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-08-24-file-and-directory-check-in-makefile/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"File and directory check in Makefile"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-09-09-just-a-brain-teaser/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Just a brain teaser"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
