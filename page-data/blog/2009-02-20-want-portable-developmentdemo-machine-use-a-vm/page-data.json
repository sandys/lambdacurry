Virtualization is the technology that is going to save the world.</p>\n<p>No really - not kidding. Actually running two VMs on a dual core machine with double everything is more power-efficient than having two single core machines.</p>\n<p>But what it is also very good for is to have an entire development set-up, that you dont even have to <em>boot up -</em> since you can just “save state” for a VM. And you can drag along the single 2 GB file to a windows, mac, unix machine and your choice of OS and all software and tools are there for you to enjoy.</p>\n<p>Just dont ask it to play music - VMs get a little screwy there.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my Virtual Machine Manager is <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org\">VirtualBox</a>. But dont use the Open Source Edition (OSE) yet - its got some issues with USB on linux.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I needed a setup with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_toolkit\">QT</a> and about 50 other toolkits chained in a particular way for it to be usable. I figured out then, that it was no use configuring it on my laptop. I cant hope to ask someone else to replicate it.</p>\n<p>So I went about creating a minimal Ubuntu 8.10 + KDE minimal 4.2 + lots of screwy libs. Now I did not want to use the stock Ubuntu install CD to install the OS on a VM. I wanted a minimal custom OS with all the goodness of Ubuntu repositories behind me (sorry <a href=\"http://www.archlinux.org\">Arch</a>).</p>\n<p>So I took a Ubuntu install cd - pressed F4 on the install screen and installed a “minimal commandline system”. Then it was time to install <em>kdelibs</em>, <em>kdebase, kdebase-bin, kdebase-plasma, kwin,</em> <em>kdebase-workspace,</em> <em>kde-workspace-data</em>, <em>kdebase-workspace-bin, kdm, g++, gdb, python-qt4, python-qt4-dev</em> and you were good to go</p>\n<p>Oh and do remember to install “linux-headers-<kernel version>”, so that you can install Virtual Box guest additions and have all the nice goodies like a nice screen resolution and auto fit guest resolution to fit window size.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Want portable development/demo machine?
