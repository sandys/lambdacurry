But then we have opinions like this where some “suit” at Sony says that they actually want to <a href=\"http://games.slashdot.org/games/09/03/01/1522259.shtml\">make it difficult</a> for developers to make games for the PS3. The compilers that the PS3 uses took a long, long time to stabilise, vs the 360.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, see what Apple did - it had to convince developers (and by developers I mean Micosoft’s Office on Mac and Adobe’s Photoshop Mac groups) to develop on transitioning hardware : from the PowerPC to Intel 32 bit to Intel 64 bit. They leveraged the power of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Level_Virtual_Machine\">LLVM</a> open source compiler architecture (which has now emerged as a competing, easier licensed, <a href=\"http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1168313&#x26;seqNum=2\">less obfuscated</a> version of gcc). They made it easier for the compiler developers to create better compilers.</p>\n<p>I own a PS3 and feel it is a really complete system - with user changeable HDDs, Linux supported, etc. but the management is really insane if it keeps on pulling such crap. Why would I want to buy a more expensive console which performs worse? And with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Natal\">Project Natal,</a> Microsoft has gone to the next level with the 360.</p>\n<p>Atleast they can open up PS2 backward compatibility for God’s sake - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a> alone would be worth it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why is Sony so dumb with the PS3 ??","date":"June 16, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-16-why-is-sony-so-dumb-with-the-ps3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-11-quickfix-for-your-linux-cddvd-writer-errors/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quickfix for your linux CD/DVD writer errors"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-06-19-quantitative-analysis-of-the-judiciarys-political-leanings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quantitative analysis of the judiciary's political leanings"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
