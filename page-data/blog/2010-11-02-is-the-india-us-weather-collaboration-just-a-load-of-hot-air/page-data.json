Those familiar with the developments are calling it Indian agriculture’s equivalent of “putting man on the moon”</p>\n<p>Once access is granted, scientists from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and Indian Space Research Organi-sation will team up with NOAA to fine-tune it to suit India’s needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What’s going on ?</p>\n<p>Either Planning Commission member, K Kasturirangan, and secretary in the department of earth sciences, Shailesh Nayak are completely clueless … or are we getting access to the supercomputer technology that is needed for these predictions?</p>\n<p>That’s because the model is already <a href=\"http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/\">available</a> freely - including the bloody <a href=\"http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/cfsv2/cfsv2_source.tar\">source code</a> [9GB download]. The source code was made publicly available on June 1 - so what are we doing with the collaboration ?</p>\n<p>To add to that, the mathematical model for the prediction system has been available since 2006</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>S.
