As it stands now, of the G-4 countries India is the one country that can provide a security, economic and political counterbalance to the Chinese influence in the South-Asian region. Japan - being dependent on the US for its security, Germany - which had better resolve the EU constitutional crisis before flailing elsewhere, Brazil - a relative newcomer to global political innuendoes are not going to stand as an effective counterbalance to the sphere of Chinese influence.</p>\n<p>Though China recognises that, in light of increasing Indo-US ties (helped in no small part by the highly influential expatriate Indian caucus in the US), it had better <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/english/NewsAnalysis/2005-04-19-voa30.cfm\">maintain</a> growing trade and economic ties with India. Similarly, we recognise the need to forge strong economic bonds with China and the <a href=\"http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/07/01/stories/2005070103321100.htm\">ASEAN</a>.</p>\n<p>As it stands, India is the country which has consistently opposed the United States on issues that appear to be skewed - be it the CTBT, <a href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/main/homepagenews/bak2005jun14.htm\">patent reforms</a> and Iraq. As the only democratic rising power in the Asian region, it has the potential (as yet to be exercised - a case in note would be our silence to the Taiwan issue, with whom we still do not diplomatic ties) to chill the fire of the Dragon’s breath.</p>\n<p>However, it is moot whether or not a permanent seat can help in doing this. A permanent seat is a recognition of power, rather than a seal of approval to exercise it. Can India, which has not opposed China on many issues (other than the venerable Dalai Lama), can do what it could not earlier? I believe that a permanent seat without the veto option is just a permanent seat-warmer with the option to talk out loud.</p>\n<p>For me, I think the Indian govt. should pursue the idea of the Ruan - a unified currency for south-asia along with creation of a Free Trade Area (a’la EU). That would be much more effective than a frikking permanent seat.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/china\">china</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/asia\">asia</a> <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/india\">india</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quest for Fool's Gold: India and the Security Council","date":"July 03, 2005"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2005-07-03-quest-for-fools-gold-india-and-the-security-council/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-06-30-attitudes-towards-leadership-asia-america-europe/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Attitudes towards leadership : Asia, America Europe"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-07-11-hahaha/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ha..Ha..Ha"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
