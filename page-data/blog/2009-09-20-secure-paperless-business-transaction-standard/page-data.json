While this is quite interesting, I have a problem with establishing PDF as an information standard. PDF is a layout mechanism - which means it defines how things look on the screen - rather than a content based mechanism. It is quite hard to parse data from within PDF in a predictable manner. According to a <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/digitalpublishing/pdfs/EPUB_datasheet.pdf\">press release</a> by Adobe itself, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB\">ePub</a> is a XML based format that looks reasonably good on a variety of screens (including mobile screens) , is machine readable and has various encryption schemes built in.</p>\n<p>Though the EU standard does define XAdES - XML Advanced Electronic Signatures - it is hardly practical, since XML (in its native form) is not human readable. What would have been best would be a hybrid format that defines layout (for human readability), <strong>as well as</strong> digital content (for machine readability).</p>\n<p>This makes it extremely hard to justify standardising on PDF rather than ePub. In India, we are yet to define a paperless standard of our own - when we do so, I hope we take this into account.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Secure paperless business transaction standard","date":"September 20, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-secure-paperless-business-transaction-standard/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-airjaldi-cost-and-terrain-effective-wireless-solution-for-rural-communities/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AirJaldi - cost and terrain effective, wireless solution for rural communities"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-09-20-indias-digital-and-internet-security-initiatives-possible-pitfalls/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"India's digital and internet security initiatives - possible pitfalls"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
