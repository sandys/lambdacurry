Hell, I use virtualization at home and I’d do it on my desktops as well - that way I can future proof my working environment across hardware failures and obsolescence.</p>\n<p>But, one of the big problems with virtualization is the ”<em>Ipod/Itunes Syndrome</em>” (my own definition!). You buy into iPod, you buy through iTunes and now you are non-portable. Even though it is called “music wherever you go”. You virtualize on X86 and suddenly, you have troubles migrating <strong><em>live</em></strong> VMs across architectures. And you cannot shut VMs down - they run websites you know.</p>\n<p>Transmeta had virtualization at the hardware level right from the beginning (Code Morphing). That could have been a compelling offering if it had been sold properly. <em>Code Morphing</em> has been widely panned because it had originally claimed native X86 like performance, which did not actually happen. But when you virtualize, you are <em>aware</em> that you will sacrifice some performance.</p>\n<p>Why has the Mac suddenly become such a compelling work environment - because of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac\">Parallels</a> . You want to develop on Linux, just create a VM - you want to play World of Warcraft on Windows, you got a VM. But the biggest problem is there is’nt a viable MacOSX VM to develop in (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&#x26;source=web&#x26;ct=res&#x26;cd=1&#x26;url=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.insanelymac.com%2Flofiversion%2Findex.php%2Ft96277-300.html&#x26;ei=x5MmScLKBdK1kAW49rzyBw&#x26;usg=AFQjCNGQWMTRu8jLZ4KNp6zek1ThaqFsLA&#x26;sig2=hGR-ZF_uTleUQtXKDRSSiQ\">Leo4VMWare</a> non-withstanding). Could Transmeta, potentially have made a viable solution? Probably.</p>\n<p>Why do I think so - because of this <a href=\"http://www.itnews.com.au/News/88463,redhat-and-amd-migrate-vms-across-cpus.aspx\">breakthrough</a>. The technological grounding behind this would be the basis of an advanced virtualization technology - something that Transmeta could have done.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transmeta and the Ipod","date":"November 21, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2008-11-21-transmeta-and-the-ipod/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-11-18-to-get-a-wife-you-need-to-rip-a-rib/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"To get a wife, you need to rip a rib"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2008-11-27-motherfs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Motherf*****s"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
