The designers.of qt,unity and gnome shell intend developers to play at creating widgets. While extensions.gnome.org is indeed nifty, the scope of things ypu can accomplish is very limited - in fact there are open bugs on gnome shells network manager, because it calls nm-applet in “external gui mode” to be able to use things like VPN.</p>\n<p>The problem is that this JavaScript focus doesnt lead to anything - if someone wants to write a serious app like Sequel Pro for gnome or qt, they definitely cannot us javascript.</p>\n<p>But gnome has a secret.weapon -Vala. Qt has no equivalent.</p>\n<p>Here’s an idea - why not make Qt the tatget for Mozilla’s systems programming language - Rust ? Two advantages to this - Qt gains a non-C++ language for writing serious apps and Rust gains its golden framework (like Rails was for Ruby) to drive adoption.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Qt needs to rust before it can be saved","date":"April 11, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2012-04-11-qt-needs-to-rust-before-it-can-be-saved/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2012-04-05-getting-hp-network-scanning-working-with-linux-12-04/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting HP network scanning working with Linux 12.04"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2012-05-03-using-freenode-xchat-on-sstp-vpn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using freenode xchat on SSTP VPN"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
