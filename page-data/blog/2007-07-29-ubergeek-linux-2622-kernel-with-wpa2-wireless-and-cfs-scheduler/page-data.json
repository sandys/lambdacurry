I have been wanting to switch to Ubuntu and get rid of my WinXP installation. However Ubuntu is notoriously finicky with WPA2 wireless security - which I use to keep my neighbors from surfing pronz on my connection.</p>\n<p>So after multiple kernel compiles, I got the perfect way to have that kernel that runs everything.</p>\n<p>In addition, I wanted to test out the <strong>Completely Fair Scheduler</strong> which is due to be merged onto the mainline 2.6.23 kernel (odd numbered .. so use at own risk). The CFS scheduler has been at the forefront of a <a href=\"http://kerneltrap.org/node/8059\">bitter fight</a> between <a href=\"redhat.com/~mingo\">Ingo Molnar</a> (2.6 kernel scheduler maintainer and author of CFS) and <a href=\"ck.wikia.com\">Con Kolivas</a> (author of Staircase Deadline scheduler). Ingo had been for a very long time, a strict opponent of the fair-scheduling approach taken by Kolivas and his <em>-ck</em> kernel patchset. Then Ingo came up with a scheduler that more or less was based on the approach that Kolivas took (also not original, but he pioneered it in the kernel). This was accepted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds\">He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named</a> and taken up for merge in the kernel. It is only quite recently that he <a href=\"http://kerneltrap.org/node/14008\">defended</a> his decision to do so.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I wanted to test out the new scheduler, because it gave a better performance on 3D games - especially <a href=\"http://armory.mmoguildsites.com/characters/north+america/khaz&#x27;goroth/dehaant\">World Of Warcraft</a></p>\n<p>Pre-requisites - make sure you have all compilers and build tools handy.
