However, the reason why this camera is dissed is due to its inability to shoot RAW, which is near essential for underwater photography of any kind.</p>\n<p>My current trip to the underwater wrecks of Sri Lanka did not get good pics because of this problem. However, there is a solution - the <a href=\"http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK\" title=\"Canon Hack Development Kit \">CHDK project</a> (Canon Hack Development Kit) for the <a href=\"chdk.wikia.com/wiki/SD960IS\">SD960</a> (<a href=\"chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=9133.45\">forum</a>). The best part is that it doesnt impact your camera firmware at all - every time your camera boots, CHDK is temporarily loaded into memory.</p>\n<p>The way to hack the SD960IS is fairly simple - first identify your current firmware. I used the <a href=\"http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/ACID\">ACID</a> utility to do that. Mine was <strong>101d</strong>. Incidentally, ACID downloaded the firmware for me, but you can download it yourself <a href=\"http://mighty-hoernsche.de/\">here</a>. Unzip the firware zip somewhere. Inside there somewhere would be four files/folders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DISKBOOT.BIN</li>\n<li>PS.FI2</li>\n<li>vers.req</li>\n<li>CHDK/ (<em>folder)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prepare your SD card:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your SD card is NOT locked (yes - I wasted many a hour because I forgot this)</li>\n<li>Partition your SD card to have two partitions (note: I used gparted to do this, use any tool that you want). A 16 mb FAT16 partition and the rest as a FAT32 partition. The larger partition is where your pictures will be stored.</li>\n<li>Make sure the 16 mb partition has “BOOT” flag set. In Gparted, you need to right click -> “manage flags” -> check “boot”</li>\n<li>Copy the four files/folders above to BOTH partitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start your camera by pressing the play button not the on/off switch. In your play menu, at the very bottom, there will be a new option called “firmware update”. Start the firmware update. CHDK should now be temporarily loaded into camera memory. You should see a brief flash of the CHDK splash screen. In any case, press “play” and then “menu” button. You should now see a different menu.</p>\n<p>Go down to ”<strong>Miscellaneous Stuff -> Make card bootable”.</strong> If this does not work for you, then the linux command that does is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> echo -n BOOTDISK | sudo dd bs=1 count=8 seek=64 of=/dev/sdb1 (where sdb1 is your 16 mb partition)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, switch off your camera, take the card out and click the SD card pin to the <strong>lock</strong> position (yes lock position. CHDK will ignore it and let you click photos without a problem. This is needed for the camera to load CHDK on every start).</p>\n<p>Now your SD card will boot CHDK every time the camera is switched on - if you get a new SD card, you’ll have to redo the steps above, since the camera is unaffected by any of this.</p>\n<p>Enable RAW mode - this is what we have been waiting for ! Press “play” and “menu” and enter <strong>“RAW Options”.</strong> Just check the ”<strong>Shoot in RAW</strong>” option and you will generate a RAW picture everytime. This is stored in a different folder called ”<strong>100Canon</strong>”. The RAW format used is DNG which is the universally accepted RAW format.</p>\n<p>The very first thing that you should do is press the shutter and get into photo shooting mode. Now pull up the CHDK menu (Play + Menu). Go to ”<strong>RAW Options”</strong> and go to ”<strong>Create badpixel.bin</strong>”. The camera will automatically take a couple of pictures for you. This <a href=\"http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Badpixel_removal\">eliminates bad pixels</a> for you when you are shooting RAW.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacking the SD960/IXUS110 for scuba photography (using RAW)","date":"March 16, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-03-16-hacking-the-sd960ixus110-for-scuba-photography-using-raw/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-03-05-why-ubuntu-should-use-android-surfaceflinger-instead-of-investing-in-mir-and-pulling-a-bada-move/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Ubuntu should use Android Surfaceflinger instead of investing in Mir and pulling a \"Bada\" move"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2013-04-19-about-culture-overheard-on-hn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About Culture - overheard on HN"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
