There is this nice article by EDA <em>femme fatale</em> <a href=\"http://www.aycinena.com/index2/template_voices.html?index3/archive/tets%20maniwa%20-%20dvcon%202006%20keynote\">Peggy Aycinena</a> that details the DVCon keynote by Synopsys Vice-President John Chilton. Synopsys evaluated the design <strong>infrastructure</strong> costs and their relation to productivity.</p>\n<p>Some very interesting findings came of it :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing from Verilog/VHDL to SystemVerilog builds verification into the design process - I think what they mean here is implementation processes; because of what he says later on</li>\n<li>SystemC is important for transaction level modeling and simulation - well SystemC is also verifiable ( I happen to make my living off that!). However, <strong>currently</strong> SystemVerilog is closer to the language that implementation tools operate on.</li>\n<li>Parallel processing - Now this is controversial . George Harper <a href=\"http://chipsandbs.blogspot.com/2006/03/auto-parallelization-of-c-code-is-not.html\">puts</a> it best on his (ongoing??) series on parallelism. It is not very easy to parallelise a lot of programs. Simulation may be one of them - they key is to break the design into blocks that dont interfere with each other . A sort of conflict graph</li>\n<li>Better place ‘n route - like TeraRoute and K-Route?</li>\n<li>Finally, full design suites - blechhhh. Well, I cant say I blame the Big Three to sneak this one in. What with the recent spate of buffet deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, this is interesting - I wonder if these are all that is important. I have heard designers ask for better usability, better look-ahead (prototyping) and … 64-bit support. Wonder why those did’nt come up.</p>\n<p>del.icio.us Tags: <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/sss8ue/eda\">eda</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Now & the future - EDA in design","date":"March 30, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2006-03-30-now-the-future-eda-in-design/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2005-12-23-should-we-emulate-the-us-in-education/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Should we emulate the US in education?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2006-04-03-magma-support-for-openaccess/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Magma support for OpenAccess"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
