Shuttleworth? Or is the answer to build an interface that allows flexibility without clutter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I should be able to search notification logs, delete them, purge them in one shot, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My solution</h2>\n<p>Here’s my proposal for a unified design</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y</a></p>\n<p>The way I envision this entire interface is somewhat like OSX Error Panes (<a href=\"http://walkingtowel.org/images/pref_panes_howto_step0.png\">http://walkingtowel.org/images/pref_panes_howto_step0.png</a>) - or something like this : <a href=\"http://web-kreation.com/demos/Sliding_login_panel_jquery/#\">http://web-kreation.com/demos/Sliding_login_panel_jquery/#</a> basically sliding down from the top panel.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that you can move the top panel around (at the bottom or be vertical on the side) and the only UI paradigm that changes is the direction of the slide.</p>\n<p>The workflow is somewhat the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/PFSkm8\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/PFSkm8</a> - initially -> click on the “notifications” button in the panel</li>\n<li>you should go to <a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/mBiAW\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/mBiAW</a> -> click on the time and date button in the “Programs” section</li>\n<li>you should go to <a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/sCsPR\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/sCsPR</a> . This page aims to loosely replicate the “Time and Date” panel button dropdown in Gnome -> click on “Preferences”</li>\n<li>you should go to <a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/6yRgU7\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/6yRgU7</a> . Notice that I am changing the “default notification display on panel” from None to “Time and Date” as well as “Skype”. Click on OK</li>\n<li>You should see the top panel now has the Time and Date and Skype buttons as well - effectively replicating the current behavior for those who prefer it. Click on the “Time and Date” button in the panel.</li>\n<li>You should have gone directly to step 3 <a href=\"https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/sCsPR\">https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#2hnvb9y/sCsPR</a></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"A philosophy of notifications - Gnome or KDE","date":"April 06, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-04-06-a-philosophy-of-notifications-gnome-or-kde/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-03-27-are-palm-apple-and-android-competing-with-blackberry-even-in-the-same-universe/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are Palm, Apple and Android competing with Blackberry, even in the same universe ?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2011-05-28-moving-from-java-to-the-jvm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Moving from Java to ... the JVM ?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
