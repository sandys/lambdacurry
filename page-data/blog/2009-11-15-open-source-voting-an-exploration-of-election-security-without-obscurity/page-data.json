Such systems can potentially make it impossible for people to claim their vote was cast falsely, ease the govt’s job to audit unused ballots and even make it <strong>impossible for</strong> <strong>political parties to buy votes</strong>.</p>\n<p>The simple fact is that security is <strong>never</strong> based on source-code - it is always based on the mathematical impossibility (or difficulty) of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function\">factoring prime numbers</a>. However this is, understandably, a difficult idea to digest - especially by laymen.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to demonstrate it is,  through real life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scantegrity.org\">Scantegrity II</a>, is a <a href=\"http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/05/30/reliable-e-voting-systems/\">reliable-voting-system</a>, developed by a team of researchers at MIT. The source code is, of course, <a href=\"http://www.scantegrity.org/wiki/index.php/Getting_the_Source\">available</a> for free -  as are any <a href=\"http://www.scantegrity.org/wiki/index.php/Scantegrity_Wiki:Copyrights#Patents_and_other_Intellectual_Property\">patents</a> related to it. This system was recently put to practice in the municipal elections at  <a href=\"http://www.scantegrity.org/takoma/index\">Takoma Park</a>, USA.</p>\n<p>One can see how wonderfully open the system is - by checking out the <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/takomapark2009audit/\">audit website</a>. The digital ”<em>seed”</em> used to randomize the data is also given away at the <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/takomapark2009audit/audit-data/meeting-4\">website</a> ! Unused ballots are <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/takomapark2009audit/audit-data/unused-ballots\">audited and released</a> to the public. Note that the Election Commission meetings themselves are audited and released to public in a <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/takomapark2009audit/audit-data/meeting-1\">verifiable manner</a>. And after the elections, any citizen can double check his/her vote on a <a href=\"http://www.scantegrity.org/takoma/checkcodes\">website</a> (however, the actual information of which vote goes to which political party is not published. Therefore there is no incentive for vote-buying).</p>\n<p>These are all part of the process for the public to maintain faith in the system. Security is not compromised by this openness - it is only enhanced. Since any citizen can potentially audit the election, it does away with the age old problem of - <em>Who will watch the watchmen ?</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Voting: an exploration of election security without obscurity","date":"November 15, 2009"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-15-open-source-voting-an-exploration-of-election-security-without-obscurity/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-09-are-we-ignoring-homegrown-tech-in-exchange-for-clever-marketing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are we ignoring homegrown tech in exchange for clever marketing ?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2009-11-18-chromeos-i-hope-it-has/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ChromeOS : I hope it has..."}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2778469899","2841359383","2882394463","3616023293"]}
